Prior work has proposed representing a method\nas a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.\nHowever, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly\nsimilar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address\nquestions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not\nexplicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific\nsense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the\nquestion and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The\nLLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing\nit to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,\nwe extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or\nhidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond\nconventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our\nscope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable\nsolutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse."}

Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to\nmaximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between\nanomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance\nof DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of\nmislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others\nappear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real\nworld, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and\nthe number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query\nstrategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of\nmislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an\nactive learning-based threshold is recommended."}

We then show that deep\nparameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields\ncompact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical\nsynchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents\na unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically\nassign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a\nnew Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively\noptimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a\nsingle model."}

However, existing methods often rely\non implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided\nreasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning\npaths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To\naddress these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit\nexploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we\nextract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and\nreflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these\nguidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct\nerrors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four\nadditional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.\nStructured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability\nand generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly\nsupport cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised\nfine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability."}

Although its prediction\nset size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of\nevidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction\nset size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are\nlarger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of\nthis attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how\neffectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically\nthe inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform\nthis by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number\nof distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess\nthe similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use\nthree conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight\ndeep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations\nfrom multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per\ninstance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast\nmajority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak\ncorrelation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate\ncorrelation.

However, existing\nopen-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities\non complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify\nthat the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information\nseeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic\ndata generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,\nlong-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer\npairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By\nleveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced\nweb agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by\nreinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100\ntool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse\ninformation-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance at its scale.

Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant.

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks.

Although extensive\nmethods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,\nrejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents\na key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and\nsecurity, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we\npropose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically\nallocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions\nof security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial\npotential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy\nand performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved\nMoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and\nhidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly\nclassifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during\nrouter optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong\nadaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including\nmainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs\noptimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for\nuser interpretability.

To further reduce computational complexity and\nimprove scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of\nsupporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the\nlimitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled\nframework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization\nmethod.

In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that\nincorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of\noffline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data\nwhen collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on\nexpert data alone."}

This iterative process continues until the policy achieves\na sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it\nis integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction\ndata from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes\ndirectional improvements to guide the Policy Planner"}

We introduce floq\n(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function\nusing a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,\ntypically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow\nis trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced\nby a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical\nintegration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling\nof the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately\nsetting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline\nRL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly\n1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,\nhighlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning."}

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive\nviews through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset\ndemonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and\nanomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when\nfine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves\nsuperior multi-class classification performance compared to existing\nself-supervised models."}

Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a\ntestbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement\ndecisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level\nmechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint\nsystem that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired\nwith neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament\ndata to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays\ngenerated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original\ngame. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool\nfor advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior\ngeneration."}

The component comprises a\nplug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and\nStrategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a \"understand-plan-select\"\ncognitive process. By generating and filtering \"intent sketch\" strategies to\nguide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves\ncross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.\nInformation-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional\nentropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing\nunintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and\nDaily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with\ntheir respective baselines, the complete \"three-module\" scheme yields\nconsistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline\ncombinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,\ndemonstrating the practical value and portability of the \"intent sketch\"\nreasoning component in zero-shot scenarios."}

Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning\nmethods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout\nor requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers\nand can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which\njointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)\nprunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,\naligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys\nmerits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps\na standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN\npruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong\nmemory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and\nGemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at\nsimilar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,\nGPU memory, and end-to-end latency."}

However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low\nhallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\ntest-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not\nconsistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more\nhallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge"}

We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model\npretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build\nmmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio\nschedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700\nlow-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing\nthat it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the\nrelatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these\nlow-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar\nclassification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5\nPro.

We propose\n\\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that\nenforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty."}

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries.

However,\nthey exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with\ngradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,\nthus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often\nneed continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired\naesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic\nRelative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as\ntext-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model\nwith optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}
