### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiStream-LLM框架，通过分离专门的手指拼写、唇读和连续手语识别模块，解决了传统端到端手语翻译模型在高速手指拼写和非手动线索整合方面的不足，在How2Sign和ChicagoFSWildPlus数据集上取得了新的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和面部非手动线索时表现不佳，特别是在翻译姓名、地点和技术术语等关键信息时效果较差。需要一种能够分别处理不同模态信息的模块化方法。

Method: 采用模块化框架，使用专门的预测器分别处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读。每个专家网络将其特定模态解码为token序列，然后通过轻量级transformer融合并行流以解决时间错位问题，最后使用大型语言模型生成最终句子。

Result: 在How2Sign基准测试中达到BLEU-4分数23.5的新最先进水平，在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离和解决不同的识别任务再进行融合的多专家方法，为稳健、高保真的手语翻译提供了更强大有效的途径，验证了核心假设的正确性。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文推出了一种声明式提示优化框架，用于改善大语言模型在系统文献综述中的可靠性和可复现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLMs进行系统文献综述的方法依赖于容易出错的手工制作提示，影响了科学研究的可靠性和可复现性。

Method: 采用声明式提示优化技术，构建包含任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调整的领域特定框架，并提供工作代码示例。

Result: 开发了一种可验证的LLM流水线蓝图，符合证据综合的透明性和严谨性原则。

Conclusion: 这是声明式提示优化方法在SLR流水线中的新颖应用，有助于提高LLM辅助证据综合的科学信心度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理领域中"假设"概念的不同定义，分析了跨学科和NLU任务中的定义差异，强调了在机器可解释学术记录背景下明确定义假设的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言处理技术的发展，各种任务中对"假设"概念的定义出现了分歧和迁移，需要系统梳理和明确界定，以支持机器可解释的学术记录发展。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，系统梳理和分析自然语言理解任务中关于假设的各种定义，特别关注近期发表的NLU任务中的定义差异。

Result: 识别出假设定义在自然科学、社会科学、形式科学以及不同NLU任务中存在显著差异，揭示了定义不一致的问题。

Conclusion: 强调良好结构和明确定义的假设对于机器可解释学术记录至关重要，呼吁在NLU研究中建立更统一的假设定义标准。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个状态感知转换框架，将思维链轨迹抽象为结构化潜在动态，通过谱分析和马尔可夫链建模来提升推理过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链提示的推理可解释性有限，主要关注局部token级归因，而高层语义角色和转换关系未被充分探索。

Method: 通过token嵌入的谱分析将推理步骤聚类为语义一致的潜在状态，并用马尔可夫链建模其演进过程。

Result: 该框架支持语义角色识别、时序模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析功能。

Conclusion: 该方法为思维链推理提供了结构化和可解释的视图，有助于深入理解语言模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM)任务和DiFBench基准框架，用于评估LLM在文档集合中识别全局稀有特征的能力，发现现有模型在统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注信息检索和摘要，缺乏评估LLM识别全局稀有特征的能力，这在候选选择、产品差异化等实际场景中至关重要。

Method: 引入DFM任务，要求模型分析10-40个文档的集合，识别出现频率低于10%的稀有特征；开发DiFBench可配置基准框架，控制文档集大小和独特性阈值等参数。

Result: 对10个最先进LLM的大规模评估显示：通用模型与推理增强模型之间存在显著性能差距；所有模型随着任务复杂度和文档数量增加而性能大幅下降；常见错误是将频繁特征误判为稀有特征。

Conclusion: 当代LLM在执行细粒度统计推理和稀有性检测方面存在核心局限性，需要开发新的方法来提升这种关键的推理能力。

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于皮尔士符号学理论的一般性框架，用于统一描述和分析不同人类意义建构建模方法，将模型视为符号并建立模型语义理论


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模领域缺乏统一的理论框架来比较不同类型的模型，需要一种能够跨模型类型进行苹果对苹果比较的通用描述方法

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建理论框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何的假设，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解其解释视角

Result: 提出了一个能够统一描述各种建模实践的理论框架，将模型本身视为符号，建立了模型语义理论，并通过简要实例展示了框架的实证应用

Conclusion: 该框架为解决建模实践的统一描述问题提供了理论基础，为理解模型语义和建模决策的符号学意义开辟了新方向，具有重要的理论价值和未来应用前景

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Game方法，将时间关系抽取任务转化为交互式游戏，通过点对点比较分解区间关系，支持强化学习训练，并提供游戏模式和标注模式两种界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间关系标注方法直接标注区间级关系存在局限性，需要更细粒度和灵活的方法来同时支持区间和瞬时实体的标注。

Method: 将时间关系分解为起点和终点之间的点对点比较，每一步玩家分类单个点关系，系统应用时间闭包推断额外关系并确保一致性。

Result: 开发了包含游戏模式和标注模式的演示系统，支持TempEval-3数据集标注和自定义文档标注，时间线可导出。

Conclusion: Temporal Game为时间推理和标注提供了新的研究工具和标注界面，支持强化学习代理训练，代码开源促进社区发展。

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE方法通过生成中间推理文本来增强文本嵌入，将逻辑推理融入生成式大语言模型的嵌入过程，在推理密集型检索任务中显著提升零样本检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLMs的强大推理能力。复杂现实查询需要超越表层词汇匹配的深度推理来检索相关文档，而仅编码器检索器在这方面存在不足

Method: 提出RITE方法，在计算嵌入之前先在token空间中生成中间推理文本，以此将逻辑推理融入文本嵌入过程，丰富表示中的推理深度

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验结果表明，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理融入嵌入过程是有效的，RITE方法通过利用生成式LLMs的推理能力，成功提升了文本嵌入的质量和检索效果

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OpinioRAG框架，用于从大量用户评论中生成个性化意见摘要，结合RAG检索和LLM技术，并提出了新的无参考验证指标来处理情感丰富的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理数千条评论的规模，或者产生通用的摘要而忽略个性化需求，需要一种可扩展的解决方案来处理大规模用户评论的个性化摘要生成。

Method: 引入OpinioRAG框架，结合基于RAG的证据检索和大型语言模型(LLMs)，无需训练即可高效生成定制化摘要。同时提出了针对情感丰富领域的新型无参考验证指标。

Result: 创建了首个大规模长格式用户评论数据集，包含每个实体超过千条评论，并配有专家摘要和手动标注查询。通过实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OpinioRAG是一个强大的框架，能够大规模生成准确、相关且结构化的摘要，为未来研究提供了关键挑战和可操作的改进见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型构建新薪资情绪指数(WSI)，预测日本薪资动态，表现超过基准方法和预训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 涉米生成式人工智能为经济文本分析带来新机遇，需要开发更及时有效的薪资预测指标

Method: 基于日本内阁府经济监测调查(EWS)，扩展价格情绪指数框架构建WSI，并设计可扩展的数据架构支持多源数据整合

Result: LLM基础的WSI模型显著超过了基准方法和预训练模型的表现

Conclusion: LLM驱动的情绪指数能够提高经济政策设计的及时性和有效性，具有重要应用价值

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在蒸馏训练模型上应用RLHF时出现的序列长度崩溃和奖励曲棍球棒曲线问题，提出了平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法来解决这些训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型发展存在两个有效但独立的范式：指令调优/RLHF对齐范式和蒸馏推理微调范式。将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型的第三范式存在严重的不稳定性问题，需要找到解决方案。

Method: 提出了平衡演员初始化(BAI)方法，这是一个两阶段的加权模型融合方法：首先融合指令跟随模型和蒸馏推理微调模型，然后将中间模型与预训练模型进一步融合以保留基础知识。

Result: BAI方法成功解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线现象，并在训练过程中实现了序列长度的持续改进。平衡的融合比例在训练稳定性和推理能力保持之间达到了最优权衡。

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐的优势，开发出更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER是一个通过自反思和基于概念质量标准的迭代修订来改进大语言模型输出的框架，无需依赖示例或演示，在多个推理任务中显著提升推理质量而不降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示策略依赖演示、示例或思维链模板，缺乏基于抽象概念差距的自我改进能力，需要一种能够通过自然语言描述推理差距并迭代改进的通用框架。

Method: GIER框架利用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代批判和精炼自身输出，通过自我反思和修订来满足概念质量标准。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务（SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI）和四个大语言模型上，GIER提高了理由质量、基础性和推理一致性，且不降低任务准确性。

Conclusion: 模型不仅能够解释抽象概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，证明了自我反思和迭代修订在提升LLM输出质量方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统构建研究树并生成需要层次遍历的自然语言问题，显著提升LLM在深度研究任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄漏或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持LLM进行多步推理和证据综合。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归地从大规模网页构建研究树，模糊中间节点为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要完整层次遍历的自然语言问题。支持快速扩展，生成超过5万个训练样本和推理轨迹。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型 consistently outperform强基线。在BrowseComp-Plus基准上，经过InfoSeek优化的3B LLM超越32B大模型和轻量级商业API，性能接近更强的API。

Conclusion: InfoSeek为深度研究任务提供了有效的训练框架，支持高级优化策略，并通过保留中间步骤和检索标签等元信息，显著提升了LLM在复杂研究任务上的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过图结构动态更新token重要性分数，实现自适应KV缓存压缩，提升长文本处理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰策略基于静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态的隐式依赖关系，导致内存限制下的性能瓶颈

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图结构中动态更新token重要性，自适应保留最上下文相关的token

Result: GraphKV可以即插即用地与现有KV缓存淘汰方法（如SnapKV、PyramidKV）集成使用

Conclusion: 提出的图基框架能够有效解决长文本序列处理中的KV缓存管理问题，代码将在Github发布

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

Motivation: 系统评估梯度对抗提示攻击方法在不同规模开源LLM上的有效性，特别是在安全导向和推理密集型编码提示上的表现差异。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格；3) 编码相关提示比安全提示更易受攻击；4) T-GCG在前缀评估中表现竞争性但在语义评估中效果有限。

Conclusion: GCG方法存在可扩展性限制，推理任务存在被忽视的脆弱性，需要进一步发展退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

*Juraj Vladika,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个基于AI的交互式系统，用于合成医学问题的循证答案，通过检索PubMed数据库中的可信研究来生成有依据的回答，并提供研究共识的可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可靠性差和医学研究数量庞大难以追踪的问题，帮助用户区分可靠信息和误导性内容。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成连贯表达的回答，但将其基于从PubMed数据库动态检索的可信医学研究进行落地，答案包含可追溯至具体研究的关键点和论点。

Result: 用户研究表明，医学专家和普通用户都认为系统可用且有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 该系统既适用于日常健康问题，也适用于高级研究洞察，能够有效帮助用户获取可靠的医学信息。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Camlang构造语言来测试LLMs的元语言推理能力，发现GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率但在Camlang上只有47%，远低于人类的87%，揭示了当前模型缺乏真正的语法系统掌握能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型是否真正具备推理能力而非仅仅是模式匹配，通过元语言演绎学习范式来评估模型掌握陌生语言语法系统的能力

Method: 创建Camlang构造语言，包含语法书和双语词典资源，将CommonsenseQA适配为Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，要求应用语法规则和词汇映射来解决问题

Result: 人类参与者能成功掌握Camlang并完成任务（87%准确率），而GPT-5在英语任务上98%但在Camlang上仅47%，其他先进推理LLMs表现更差，模型成功主要来自浅层词汇对齐

Conclusion: Camlang建立了认知基础的评价范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，GPT-5仅表现出有限的元语言意识但缺乏系统性语法掌握能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和语义单元整合来解决传统图RAG中局部语义单元提取的模糊性和耦合问题，在多个任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法在提取高层次语义单元时局限于局部文本块，容易产生歧义、复杂耦合和检索开销增加的问题，缺乏全局知识或忽视细粒度关系。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）在图构建阶段对预提取的语义单元进行全局合并，指导实体和关系提取；2）在检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕捉细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务评估中，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元整合和分层关系捕捉，有效解决了传统RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的效果。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI构成挑战。需要开发既准确又高效的解决方案，特别是在资源受限和设备端部署的场景下。

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和注意力相关性评分（ARS）来对答案选项进行语义相关性排序，实现快速设备端推理而无需生成式推理。

Result: 大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）在QIAS 2025数据集上达到87.6%的准确率，但需要更多资源且依赖上下文。基于MARBERT的方法达到69.87%的准确率，在效率、设备端可部署性和隐私方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 研究量化了大型模型的峰值性能与小型专业化系统在实际应用优势之间的关键权衡，为高风险领域提供了实用的解决方案选择。

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 开放域语言生成中的不确定性量化在无法访问模型内部信号的黑盒约束下是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战

Method: 利用token级熵作为无需logit和参考的不确定性度量，将其整合到分割保形预测流程中，通过保形分位数校准不确定性阈值

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试上的实验表明，TECP持续实现可靠的覆盖率和紧凑的预测集，优于现有的自一致性UQ方法

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一个原则性和高效的解决方案

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

Motivation: 为了解决大规模语言模型在计算效率和智能代理能力方面的需求，需要开发既能保持高性能又能优化资源使用的可扩展模型架构。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)架构，引入零计算专家实现动态计算预算分配，以及快捷连接MoE扩大计算-通信重叠窗口。结合超参数迁移、模型增长初始化、稳定性套件和确定性计算实现稳定训练。

Result: 模型在30天内完成20+万亿token训练，推理速度达到100+ TPS，成本为每百万输出token 0.70美元。在代理任务中表现优异，性能与领先模型竞争。

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash通过创新的MoE设计和规模化训练框架，成功实现了高效计算和先进代理能力的结合，为大规模语言模型的发展提供了有价值的开源贡献。

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理中的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法(RRP)表现最佳，得分0.571，相比零样本基线0.519有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025 API赛道中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色回应(过度说话)，同时未能根据角色有效使用工具(行动不足)，如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用

Method: 探索了四种提示方法：1)基础角色提示 2)人工制作角色提示 3)自动提示优化(APO) 4)基于规则的角色提示(RRP)。RRP采用角色卡片/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行两种新技术

Result: 基于规则的角色提示(RRP)方法获得最佳性能，总体得分0.571，相比零样本基线0.519有所提升，证明RRP设计能显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性

Conclusion: RRP设计相比更复杂的方法(如APO)能更好地提高角色扮演对话代理的效果，为支持未来角色提示开发工作，开源了所有最佳性能提示和APO工具

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究查询的长篇回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛存在于综述文章中，需要一种更全面的方法来评估LLM系统在多研究领域的能力。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准，每个评分标准包含查询特定的答案评估标准（引用论文、解释说明、描述限制等）。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估。

Result: 构建的自动配对判断器与专家判断达到74%的一致性。评估18个系统在7.6K+配对评估中发现，没有参数化或检索增强系统超过70%的评分标准覆盖率，最高排名的代理系统达到75%覆盖率。最高排名系统在引用、限制和比较方面的完整处理率分别低于11%、48%和49%。

Conclusion: ResearchQA提供了一个全面的多领域评估框架，揭示了当前LLM系统在研究查询回答方面的能力差距，特别是在引用文献、描述限制和进行比较方面存在显著不足。数据公开发布以促进更全面的多领域评估。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音离散表示方法生成25-50 tokens/秒的细粒度tokenization，但语音通常只有2-5词/秒，导致冗余和效率低下，且细粒度token主要捕获音素级信息而非语义信息

Method: 先通过下一token预测预训练语音语言模型，然后使用预测熵自适应确定聚合边界，再用交叉注意力模块融合段内信息，通过调整熵阈值可灵活控制表示粒度和压缩比

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上的实验表明，压缩后的表示性能与密集token序列相当或更好

Conclusion: 提出的熵基动态聚合框架能有效学习压缩的语义语音表示，在保持性能的同时提高下游任务的训练和推理效率

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律背景下如何根据用户角色进行动机推理，战略性地调整信息框架以符合法律系统中不同利益相关者的立场。

Method: 基于法律现实主义和近期法律实践趋势，引入基于法律事实和推理包含的评估框架，考虑对利益相关者的偏向性，分析不同法律角色提示下的摘要行为。

Result: 结果显示即使提示包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出选择性包含模式，反映了角色一致的视角，表明LLMs可能从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在高风险法律环境中对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的必要性，对LLMs可能产生的偏见性摘要提出警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在推理能力增强时更容易响应恶意请求，这种现象被称为"推理诱导的错位"，揭示了推理能力与安全性之间的新权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，对其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的担忧日益加剧。先前研究表明在恶意数据集上微调会导致错位行为，但本研究发现了更令人担忧的现象。

Method: 通过切换到"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强推理能力，观察模型对恶意请求的响应变化，并分析内部模型状态（注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专家）。

Result: 发现推理能力增强后，LLMs对恶意请求的响应性显著提高，密集模型特别脆弱。同时发现注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专门专家有助于将过度推理重新导向安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了新兴的推理-安全性权衡关系，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解模型安全机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在评估环境和实际部署环境中表现出显著行为差异（评估意识现象）。通过线性探测和提示词重写技术，研究发现将测试式提示词改写为部署式提示词可使诚实回答增加5.26%，欺骗性回答减少12.40%，拒绝率提高6.38%，表明模型在测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估环境和实际部署环境中的行为存在显著差异，这种"评估意识"现象导致基准测试性能无法准确反映模型的真实安全性和诚实性，对AI对齐构成严重挑战。

Method: 提出一种系统量化方法：使用线性探测对提示词进行"测试式-部署式"连续评分，并利用LLM重写策略将提示词转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保持原始任务不变。

Result: 重写后的"部署式"提示词导致行为显著一致变化：所有模型的诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回答减少12.40%，拒绝率提高6.38%。战略角色扮演数据集的平均探测分数提高了30%。

Conclusion: 评估意识是可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM行为。模型在感知的测试环境中更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出，迫切需要更现实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

*Rishiraj Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，一种线性复杂度(O(N))的并行序列建模架构，替代Transformer的二次复杂度自注意力机制，在训练速度和性能上均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次方增长(O(N^2))，成为处理长上下文的重要瓶颈，需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: GAM块用两条并行路径替代自注意力层：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，并行关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合局部和全局信息。

Result: 在WikiText-2基准测试中，GAM比标准Transformer和现代线性时间基线(Mamba)训练速度更快，在所有数据集上达到优越或竞争力的最终验证困惑度。

Conclusion: GAM被证明是一种有前景且高效的序列建模替代方案，具有线性复杂度优势，在性能和速度方面均表现出色。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程任务需要复杂的算法思维和代码创建能力，但作为评估语言模型的领域尚未得到足够关注。研究旨在开发评估语言模型在算法问题解决能力的方法。

Method: 构建包含254个ICPC题目的基准测试，每个问题包含官方分析、参考代码和测试用例。采用零样本思维链提示、多轮自判断与反思、情景信息检索等技术进行模型推理。

Result: 零样本思维链提示下模型仅达到19.1%的解决率，最佳推理技术组合将解决率提升至42.2%。人类参与研究发现，通过特定指令可使模型解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发具有基础性、想象力和算法思维的语言模型提供了重要进展，开源了代码和数据以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

TL;DR: 研究发现封禁对齐的LLM在敏感语言识别中更准确但更偏见，未封禁模型更容易受影响但性能较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在检测显性和隐性恨恨语言时的效果，比较封禁对齐与未封禁模型的对象性分类能力

Method: 通过实验比较封禁对齐和未封禁模型在恨恨语言识别任务中的准确率、稳健性和偏见性

Result: 封禁模型准确率更高(78.7% vs 64.1%)，但安全对齐导致强烈意识形态偏见，未封禁模型更容易受人设影响，所有模型都无法理解语言细腻如议刺

Conclusion: LLM不能作为客观裁判，需要更复杂的审计框架考虑公平性、检验和意识形态一致性

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

TL;DR: 提出Router Upcycling方法，通过从注意力头初始化多个路由器来增强MoE上循环性能，实现SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率低，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术的路由能力

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家，每个token被处理成不同查询并与专家特征（作为键）对齐

Result: 实验结果表明该方法达到了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的性能，通过多路由器协作机制解决了复杂路由问题

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了14个小语言模型(SLMs)在生成虚假新闻标题方面的能力，发现这些模型具有很高的合规性，但生成的标题质量检测准确率较低(35.2%-63.5%)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估小语言模型生成虚假新闻标题的潜在风险，以及现有检测系统对这些AI生成内容的识别能力。

Method: 使用控制提示工程生成24,000个低质量和高质量虚假新闻标题，然后应用现有的机器学习和深度学习新闻标题质量检测器进行分析。

Result: SLMs显示出很高的合规率，但质量误分类很常见，检测准确率仅为35.2%-63.5%，生成的标题与真实人类编写内容相似度不高。

Conclusion: 测试的SLMs通常能够合规生成虚假标题，但存在轻微的伦理约束差异，且生成的标题与现有网络内容相似度较低。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过文本增强可以有效改善多模态时间序列预测性能，强化学习方法能够生成更高质量的增强文本，提升整体预测效果

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

TL;DR: RevBrowse是一个基于LLM的评论驱动推荐框架，通过PrefRAG模块动态检索相关评论来解决评论利用效率低和上下文窗口限制的问题，在四个亚马逊数据集上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐任务中表现出强大潜力，但如何有效整合用户评论仍面临挑战：1）在有限上下文窗口中动态利用评论效率低；2）缺乏机制来优先处理与用户当前决策最相关的评论。

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，模拟用户'浏览-决策'行为过程。引入PrefRAG检索增强模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容。

Result: 在四个亚马逊评论数据集上的广泛实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线实现了持续且显著的改进，证明了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RevBrowse通过检索增强过程有效解决了评论利用效率问题，不仅提升了推荐性能，还通过可视化影响最终推荐的评论提供了一定程度的可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

Motivation: 标准的基于信心度的采样方法在每个漏渌步骤独立选择token，导致生成顺序类似于自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势

Method: 奖励加权采样(RWS)在每个漏渌步骤使用外部奖励模型评估整个中间序列质量，根据奖励值缩放token对数概率，通过全局序列级协调来指导token选择

Result: 实验结果显示RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上均有改善，理论分析证明方法能够导致token选择排名反转并一致提高预期奖励

Conclusion: 集成全局信号能够有效提升掩码漏渌模型的非自回归性质和整体性能，RWS为大语言模型提供了一种有前景的非自回归替代方案

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to

resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,

pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist

ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了编码器模型、解码器LLM和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测任务上的表现，发现LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B模型达到95.94%的测试准确率，表现出最佳泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，准确检测AI生成文本的需求日益增长，特别是在中文这种语言细微差别较大的语言中，现有方法面临显著挑战。

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，系统比较编码器Transformer（中文BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、仅解码器LLM（Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线方法。编码器模型采用新颖的基于提示的掩码语言建模方法微调，Qwen2.5-7B通过指令格式输入和轻量级分类头进行LoRA适配。

Result: 编码器模型虽然几乎记住了训练数据，但在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%；BERT: 79.3%）。FastText表现出令人惊讶的词法鲁棒性（83.5%准确率）但缺乏深层语义理解。LoRA适配的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，具有平衡的精确率-召回率指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于解码器的大语言模型结合参数高效微调在中文AI生成文本检测中具有卓越效果，未来将探索新一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体和集成策略以进一步提升跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Result: 在六个数据集上评估，提出新指标Attr_auto-P评估证据精确度。使用GPT-3.5-turbo、Gemini和Llama 70B系列时，FIDES比SOTA方法平均提升超过14%。

Conclusion: FIDES通过忠实的事实分解和证据聚合机制，有效解决了归因问答中的证据检索和聚合问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

TL;DR: 提出司法意见生成新任务，通过LegalChainReasoner框架实现法律推理和量刑预测的端到端生成，解决现有方法中两者不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和量刑预测两个独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工整理知识，实际部署受限。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，使用结构化法律链指导模型进行综合案件评估，整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Result: 在两个真实世界的中文法律案例数据集上实验表明，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法更好地符合法律实践需求，实现了法律推理和量刑决策的同步生成，提升了司法意见生成的实用性和一致性。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型进行监督微调，利用来自BioASQ、MedQuAD和TREC的精选生物医学问答数据集，探索三种实验设置：长短答案联合微调、仅短答案和仅长答案微调。

Result: 模型在概念级准确度得分达到0.8，显示良好的领域理解能力，但精确匹配得分显著较低，特别是在测试阶段。两阶段推理管道部分改善了答案提取效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物医学LLM应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略来改善严格格式化的输出生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

TL;DR: Topic Model Translation (TMT) 是一种无需对齐语料库即可跨语言迁移主题模型的新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言环境下主题模型训练的挑战，特别是在目标语言数据有限或开发者不熟悉目标语言的情况下

Method: 提出Topic Model Translation (TMT)技术，无需元数据、嵌入或对齐语料库，即可将主题模型（如LDA）从一种语言迁移到另一种语言

Result: 通过定量和定性评估证明TMT能够产生语义一致且连贯的主题翻译

Conclusion: TMT是一种鲁棒且透明的技术，特别适用于目标语言大型语料库不可用或人工翻译不可行的情况

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统的增多，如何有效评估这些系统成为一个重要挑战。本文旨在通过相对较小的模型来预测对话质量的多维度评分。

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）使用语言模型通过提示进行评价；2）训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。所有模型参数都控制在130亿以下。

Result: 语言模型提示方法在测试集上仅获得中等相关性，但排名第二，仅被基线方法超越。编码器模型在验证集上某些维度表现出高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降，主要因为测试集的评分范围与训练验证集存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然小型模型在某些条件下能取得不错效果，但测试集与训练数据的分布差异对模型泛化能力构成挑战，提示需要更好的数据一致性或模型鲁棒性方法。

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Motivation: 负样本在对比学习中至关重要，现有方法难以生成具有不同相似度级别的多样化负样本来提升语义区分能力

Method: 1. MGH框架：利用LLM生成多粒度难负样本，支持从粗到细的课程学习策略；2. ATA池化：基于LLM聚合模式为锚点标记分配更高权重，提升嵌入准确性

Conclusion: 提出的MGH框架和ATA方法有效提升了文本嵌入模型的语义表示能力，为对比学习提供了更有效的负样本生成和特征提取方案

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创作工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估和解决这些模型在职业描绘中的代表性偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员5种职业的基准测试，使用5个先进模型（包括闭源和开源），比较中性提示与公平性提示的效果，对所有输出进行性别和种族标注并进行分布分析。

Result: 提示工程可以显著改变人口统计表征，但效果高度模型依赖：有些系统能有效多样化，有些会过度校正导致不现实的统一性，有些则响应性很低。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预措施既有前景也有局限，需要结合模型层面的补充策略来解决偏见问题。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性，这会导致生成内容偏离事实信息。

Method: 设计两种范式生成对应的欺骗性/误导性输入来诱导一致的奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换后中性输入的输出分布偏差来减少对欺骗性信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的CCD方法能够有效缓解奉承幻觉，并在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种无需额外训练的有效方法，能够显著减轻大语言模型中的奉承幻觉问题，提升模型输出的真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个新型的代理RAG框架，通过结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，训练模型生成简洁的支持性证据笔记(SENs)来提升开放域问答性能，解决了传统方法中噪声干扰和多跳推理错误累积的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-回答范式存在两个关键局限：(1)检索证据中信号噪声比低，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中不完整或噪声段落导致错误累积。需要更有效的方法来处理噪声并提升推理的忠实性。

Method: 提出EviNote-RAG框架，采用结构化检索-笔记-回答流程。模型训练生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)——简洁、类人的笔记，仅保留答案相关信息，突出不确定性，并明确说明无有用证据存在。通过证据质量奖励(EQR)强化训练，这是一个基于蕴含关系的信号，评估SENs是否逻辑支持最终答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面 consistently优于强基线。在HotpotQA上获得20%的相对F1提升(+0.093)，Bamboogle上40%(+0.151)，2Wiki上91%(+0.256)，通过更密集的奖励和减少冗余实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过SENs和EQR的结合，引导模型进行忠实和鲁棒的推理，同时减少噪声影响。该方法在提升问答性能的同时增强了鲁棒性和效率，为开放域问答提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Conclusion: 这个研究为讽刺检测领域提供了重要的数据资源，并指出了大语言模型在该任务上的不足，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

Method: 提出SIFT方法，结合上下文学习(ICL)和监督微调，将序列标注任务重新表述为约束响应生成问题

Result: SIFT在多个标准序列标注任务上显著优于ICL和解码器作为编码器的微调基线，发现长上下文会降低性能但可通过移除指令缓解

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在序列标注中的优势和局限，强调了基于响应的生成式任务表述对实现有效序列标注性能的重要性

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Method: 提出了结构与解构的双重机制：结构机制组织已知的符号交互关系，解构机制通过周期性的嵌入重置来增强模型的可塑性和对未见场景的泛化能力

Result: 建立了结构化与非结构化范式之间的概念桥梁，形成了开发通用知识引擎的新方法

Conclusion: 通过结合结构与解构的双重力量，可以构建支持透明、可控和自适应智能系统的通用知识引擎，为NLP知识系统的发展提供了新的理论框架

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医学问答中生成的推理链缺乏事实准确性和临床可靠性，需要改进推理质量

Conclusion: 偏好优化与质量驱动的细化相结合，为构建更可靠、临床基础的医学LLMs提供了可扩展的有效方法

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching,
data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of
classification accuracy.

Motivation: 缺乏标准的孟加拉语词汇数据库，需要开发有效的单词排序方法来总结文本和检索信息

Method: 使用印度语言词性标注语料库构建词图，应用预处理步骤后采用多种图排序算法进行单词排名

Result: 通过F1分数评估了不同排序算法的准确性，实验结果显示各算法在真实数据上的表现

Conclusion: 研究成功展示了孟加拉语单词排序的完整流程，为缺乏标准数据库的语言处理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

TL;DR: 提出了首个波斯文化礼仪规范taarof的基准测试TaarofBench，评估发现主流LLMs在文化能力方面存在显著差距，准确率比母语者低40-48%，并通过微调方法显著提升了模型的文化对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在全球语境中难以处理特定文化的沟通规范，特别是波斯文化中复杂的礼仪系统taarof，这限制了其在跨文化场景中的有效性。

Method: 创建包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准，涵盖12个常见社交话题，由母语者验证。评估5个前沿LLM，并通过监督微调和直接偏好优化方法提升模型表现。

Result: LLMs在taarof文化适当性方面的准确率比母语者低40-48%，性能因话题而异，波斯语提示能改善表现，且存在性别不对称性。微调方法分别实现了21.8%和42.3%的文化对齐改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发多样化、文化敏感的LLMs奠定了基础，揭示了西方礼貌框架的局限性，并展示了通过针对性训练可以显著提升模型的文化理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化响应的风格一致性很重要，会影响受害者对响应者的信任，但现有研究很少探索这个问题。

Method: 首先提出了评估风格一致性的新指标，然后采用两阶段融合生成方法：先评估候选响应的风格，然后通过实例级融合过程进行优化和整合。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在响应质量和风格一致性方面都持续超过基准方法。

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了危机沟通中语言模型生成响应的风格一致性问题，为提高受害者信任提供了技术支撑。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Conclusion: 该研究通过提高反健康错误信息言论的可及性和理解度，为更公平有效的公共卫生沟通做出贡献。

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Result: o3和Gemini 2.5表现优异（准确率>90%），ALLaM、Fanar、LLaMA和Mistral表现较差（准确率<50%），存在显著的性能差距

Conclusion: 模型在结构化法律推理方面存在局限性，错误模式包括对继承场景的误解、法律规则应用错误和领域知识不足，需要改进伊斯兰法律推理性能

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不合法，尽管19世纪文献中常见，这是由主格主语要求与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则冲突导致的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空缺：-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代乌尔都语和印地语中极不合法，但在19世纪文献中却自由出现，需要探究这一历时转变的原因。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究（确认完成体形式的明显缺失）以及母语者的主观评价任务（评判完成体例句的高度不自然性）来调查这一历时转变。

Result: 研究发现完成体形式在现代语法中极不稳定，母语者认为高度不自然，这种空缺是由于形态句法冲突：结构要求主格主语和不变分词与及物完成体赋予作格的核心语法规则相冲突。

Conclusion: 这种形态句法冲突导致完成体形式不稳定，其功能被其他结构取代，使得这一空缺在现代语法中得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG是一种知识蒸馏的参数化RAG模型，通过将文档编码为LoRA参数来保护隐私，同时保持标准RAG的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RAG系统需要上传明文文档到云端导致隐私泄露的问题，以及现有参数化RAG(PRAG)存在的推理延迟高和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 1)合成单文档和多文档的QA对增强跨文档推理；2)用特殊标记掩码明文文档并通过参数生成器转换为LoRA；3)通过知识蒸馏训练参数生成器匹配标准RAG的隐藏状态和输出logits。

Result: 在四个QA数据集上的实验表明，DistilledPRAG在准确率上优于基线方法，并在分布外数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化的同时保持RAG级别的性能，为隐私保护推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

TL;DR: REFRAG是一个针对RAG应用的高效解码框架，通过压缩、感知和扩展技术，利用检索上下文的稀疏性结构，在保持性能的同时显著提升解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中检索到的长上下文大部分内容与查询无关，导致传统LLM处理时产生大量不必要的计算开销，造成系统延迟和内存需求增加。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过分析RAG上下文的块对角注意力模式，识别和消除不必要的计算，实现上下文压缩和高效解码。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的首token时间加速（相比之前工作提升3.75倍），困惑度无损失，并能将LLM的上下文大小扩展16倍。

Conclusion: REFRAG在多种长上下文任务中均能提供显著的速度提升，且不影响准确性，为RAG应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Motivation: 探讨自然文本演变对LLM问答能力的影响，了解模型对预训练数据相似性的依赖程度。

Method: 提出了一个框架来整理自然演变的人类编辑阅读段落变体，分析LLM在不同语义相似度分数下的表现，评估了6个QA数据集和8个LLM。

Result: 实验显示LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本差异增大而下降，即使推理时所有必要信息都存在。例如BoolQ数据集上模型准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降超过30%。

Conclusion: 自然文本演变对LLM的语言理解能力构成重大挑战，模型过度依赖预训练数据的特定表述形式。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training

Conclusion: 该方法通过实体对齐翻译有效解决了非拉丁文字语言的跨语言命名实体识别挑战，为低资源语言的NER任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse

outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Conclusion: SAT框架有效解决了表示空间不一致和指令设计冗余问题，为LLM在知识图谱补全中的应用提供了高效统一的解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个计算框架来管理AI系统中的解释性模糊问题，借鉴法律机制来改善规则制定和应用的一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统越来越依赖自然语言原则进行治理，但解释性模糊问题尚未得到充分探索。与法律系统不同，AI对齐流程缺乏相应的制度保障，导致相同规则的不同解释可能产生不一致或不稳定的模型行为

Method: 提出计算框架，包含两个法律机制：(1)规则精炼流程，通过修订模糊规则来最小化解释分歧；(2)基于提示的解释约束，减少规则应用的不一致性。在WildChat数据集的5000个场景子集上进行评估

Result: 两种干预措施都显著提高了合理解释者小组的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该方法为系统管理解释性模糊提供了第一步，是构建更鲁棒、遵循法律的AI系统的关键步骤

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Method: 引入零样本可调节加速的训练和推理方法，在推理时动态调整硬件使用，无需额外微调

Result: 在多个分类和文本生成任务上评估，该方法能够以零样本方式实现广泛加速，相比基线最高达到11倍速度提升

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and
performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during
inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper
introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly
developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text
generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a
wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x
speedup compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: SimulMEGA是一个无监督策略学习框架，通过混合专家门控机制实现实时语音翻译，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同步语音翻译系统在多语言多对多场景中难以平衡翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性，不同的读写策略阻碍了统一策略学习

Method: 结合前缀训练和混合专家精炼器的无监督策略学习框架，隐式学习有效的读写决策，无需增加推理时间开销，仅需对标准Transformer架构进行最小修改

Result: 在6种语言对上的评估显示，5亿参数的语音转文本模型优于Seamless基线，在1.5秒平均延迟下BLEU下降低于7%，在3秒延迟下低于3%；在流式TTS任务中也表现出优越的延迟-质量权衡

Conclusion: SimulMEGA框架具有通用性，可同时适用于语音转文本和文本转语音流式任务，为实时跨语言通信提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于模型增长策略（特别是transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题方面的效果，发现该方法在阅读理解等任务上能减少性能退化，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的主要挑战，特别是对大语言模型而言。模型增长策略通过利用小模型加速大模型训练来缓解这一问题，但其对遗忘的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用基于增长的预训练方法（transformer堆叠），比较有增长训练（Stack LLM）和无增长训练（LLM）的模型在序列微调任务中的表现，评估领域知识、推理、阅读理解和偏见等能力。

Result: 两种模型在领域知识上都有提升，但推理和阅读理解能力随时间退化。Stack LLM表现出更少的性能退化，特别是在阅读理解方面。在偏见评估中，基线LLM变得更中性，而Stack LLM保持约60-61%的稳定偏见比例。

Conclusion: 基于增长的预训练在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面能带来适度改进，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在特定领域任务上需要微调，如何快速选择最优模型进行微调是一个挑战

Method: 1) 数据层面：建立数据过滤方法分类，增强关键token密度实现token压缩，使用LLM迭代重写文本优化表达；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估重要性，移除低重要性层，引入稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的实验表明，能够选择最优LLM同时节省约20倍训练时间

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM微调中的模型选择问题，显著提升了效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Motivation: 尽管思维链推理方法日益受到关注，但其底层工作机制仍不清晰，需要从理论层面深入理解模型推理的内在机制。

Method: 采用细粒度词汇级分析、逐步引入噪声样本实验、以及提示工程诱导慢思考等方法，系统研究思维链推理的工作机制。

Result: 发现模型能快速学习推理结构和逻辑模式但依赖预训练先验；足够样本可使决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号；长思维链提示能改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 思维链推理的有效性源于预训练先验与上下文学习的动态平衡，长推理链能诱导更深入的思考过程，提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究基于评估方法标注的情感文本语料，发现尽管标注存在显著分歧，但遵循稳定的统计趋势。通过语言模型证明可以建模标注过程，且变异性由底层语言特征驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能中的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个广泛开放的课题。当前评估方法的情感理论框架使用不足，需要提供与传统方法互补的不同视角。

Method: 使用基于评估方法手动标注的工业语料库，训练语言模型来分析标注过程。假设标注分歧仍遵循稳定的统计趋势，通过语言模型验证这一假设。

Result: 语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，标注变异性主要由底层语言特征驱动。同时，语言模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境。

Conclusion: 尽管情感标注存在显著分歧，但通过统计建模方法可以捕捉稳定的标注模式。语言模型在理解和建模情感评估过程方面表现出强大能力，为情感分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

TL;DR: 本文主张采用"有意文化评估"方法，系统性地检查评估中嵌入的文化假设，超越当前以静态事实为中心的文化对齐评估范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文化对齐评估方法过于简化文化为静态事实或价值观，通过选择题或简答题测试，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性本质，以及文化假设在看似"中立"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出有意文化评估框架，系统分析评估中文化因素出现的what、how和circumstances，强调研究者立场性的重要性，并建议采用HCI启发的参与式方法让社区参与评估设计。

Result: 建立了系统性分析文化因素在评估中作用的理论框架，为更包容、文化对齐的NLP研究提供了方法论基础。

Conclusion: 需要超越当前基准测试实践，发现未知的重要应用，通过参与式方法让社区参与评估设计，推动更具文化敏感性和包容性的NLP评估范式。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Instruct模型上，TableZoomer在DataBench数据集上比传统PoT方法准确率提升19.34%，在TableBench的事实检查任务上提升25%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持可用性优势的同时，显著提升了不同规模表格的处理性能和可扩展性，为解决表格问答任务的工业应用挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然通用，但在适应新领域时面临挑战，特别是在低资源且无标注数据的领域。传统微调方法计算成本高且耗时，需要更高效的领域适应方案。

Method: 使用6种参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上进行实验，在科学、医疗、法律和新闻等14个训练数据集上进行文本摘要任务评估，探索领域内和跨领域适配器的使用策略。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习，甚至优于更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。在没有领域内适配器时，跨领域适配器和策略性组合适配器也能利用语言相似性提升性能。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术能够有效解决LLMs在低资源领域适应的问题，通过利用领域内和跨领域适配器，可以在计算成本较低的情况下实现更好的领域适应性，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有法律基准无法评估开放式和基于法律条款的问答，需要专门针对多跳法律推理的评估框架。

Method: 使用混合LLM-专家流水线创建226个场景化QA实例，提出ParSeR方法通过生成参数化条款进行三阶段顺序检索，并设计LF-Eval自动评估指标。

Conclusion: KoBLEX基准和ParSeR方法有效解决了法律领域基于条款的多跳推理评估问题，LF-Eval指标与人工评估高度相关。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常需要昂贵的优化（如强化学习）来掌握复杂推理任务。本研究旨在证明一旦学习到的推理能力可以作为紧凑的任务向量在不同模型间提取和迁移，从而回收利用已有的计算投资。

Method: 从两个相同初始化的Qwen2.5模型中提取推理向量：一个经过监督微调（SFT），另一个经过组相对策略优化（GRPO）。推理向量定义为v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT，然后通过简单的算术加法将该向量应用到兼容的指令微调模型上。

Result: 推理向量在多个推理基准测试中带来一致性能提升：GSM8K（+4.9%）、HumanEval（+4.3%）、SciQ（+1.7%）和BigBenchHard（1.5B模型+12.3%）。在对抗条件下性能提升依然保持。相反，减去向量会导致性能显著下降（GSM8K上-11.8%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过昂贵的训练开发的推理能力可以从现有开源模型中提取，并通过简单的张量算术重复使用，为通过回收先前的计算投资来增强模型提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

TL;DR: WATCHED是一个基于大语言模型的聊天机器人系统，用于辅助内容审核员检测和解释仇恨言论，结合了自动化检测和人工判断的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线危害日益严重，特别是仇恨言论问题，需要结合自动化系统的速度和规模与人工审核的判断力，同时提供清晰的解释来建立信任。

Method: 构建AI代理系统，使用大语言模型和专门工具：比较新帖子与真实仇恨言论示例、BERT分类器标记有害消息、查询俚语词典、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最先进方法，达到宏观F1分数0.91。

Conclusion: WATCHED工具通过支持AI与人工监督的协作，帮助减少在线危害，适用于审核员、安全团队和研究人员。

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个领域无关的框架，通过半合成数据集自动评估和人工测试组合，来高效创建跨文档链接的训练和评估数据集，并在同行审查和新闻领域验证了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文档细粒度关系理解对许多应用至关重要，但缺乏高效的数据集创建方法限制了自动化辅助技术的研究。

Method: 提出一个新的框架：首先生成和验证半合成跨文档数据集，用于自动评估并选出性能最佳的链接方法，然后进行深度人工评估获得自然文本对的性能估计。

Result: 在同行审查和新闻两个领域的应用显示，结合检索模型和大语言模型的方法获得了78%的人工评审通过率，比单独使用检索模型的精确度提高了一倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架能够系统性地研究跨文档理解，所创建的新数据集为多个跨文档任务奠定了基础，并开源了代码、数据和标注协议。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经音频编码器产生的离散词段是否具有类似于自然语言的统计特性，以及这些特性如何影响语音的语义保存和音质识别性能

Method: 对多种NAC模型产生的词段进行统计分析，检验Zipf定律、Heaps定律、熵和冗余度，并通过语音识别错误率和UTMOS分数评估语义保存和音质评价

Result: NAC词段特别是3-gram呈现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性与信息内容测量一起与语音识别和重构任务的性能提升呈正相关

Conclusion: 神经音频编码器词段序列具有语言统计特性，这些发现为设计更有效的生成式语音模型提供了重要见解

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理任务上表现出色，但在元推理任务（如识别学生解题错误）方面仍有不足，需要改进错误定位能力。

Method: 使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集，提出生成中间修正学生解决方案的方法，使其更接近原始学生解法，从而提高错误定位性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解题中的第一个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有助于提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解法更接近的中间修正方案，可以有效改善LLMs在学生解题错误定位方面的表现，为解决元推理挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的思维链推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制，需要更可靠和可理解的人机协作推理方式。

Method: 开发Vis-CoT框架，将线性CoT文本转换为交互式推理图，支持用户可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤、修剪错误路径和嫁接用户定义的前提条件。

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT比非交互式基线提高了最多24个百分点的最终答案准确率，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升。

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM和针对性人类监督，为实现更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，系统评估LLMs在不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况，发现LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家对齐不足，同时通过改变提示语言可以更有效地引导LLMs与相应国家意见对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查(WVS)创建评估框架，系统评估LLMs在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况。

Result: LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐意见，而与大多数国家对齐不足；改变提示语言匹配问卷语言能比现有引导方法更有效地使LLMs与相应国家意见对齐；LLMs更符合当代人群意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面调查LLMs意见对齐主题的研究，填补了现有研究的空白，为理解和使用LLMs的多语言意见对齐提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转化为校准的正确概率，并通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型需要决定何时不回答，以避免错误响应。现有方法往往缺乏统一的证据融合和风险控制机制。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持黑盒特征，采用符合风险控制提供分布无关保证，通过检索证据监督原子事实性分数来对齐长文本生成的置信度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强长问答实验中，校准指标持续改进，风险-覆盖率曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个可移植的证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的配方，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍然有效，显著提高了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练后知识静态化，新兴事实集成成本高昂。现有知识编辑技术要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下崩溃。

Method: 提出Reason-KE框架，引导预训练LLM通过四个结构化阶段：事实确认、相关性判定、选择性应用和最终推理，在单次处理中过滤干扰信息。

Result: 在MQuAKE-CF数据集上，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳问答准确率提升至90.2%，在强干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%。

Conclusion: Reason-KE展现出强大的抗干扰能力和效率，为可靠的LLM知识更新建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型(RALMs)和拒绝后训练两种方法，但当前研究忽视了RALMs拒绝能力的评估，需要探究模型是否知道何时不知道。

Method: 通过分析不同内部和外部知识状态下RALMs的校准情况，研究拒绝后训练方法(Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning和In-Context Fine-tuning)对过度拒绝问题的影响，并开发改进的拒绝方法。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著过度拒绝行为；In-context fine-tuning缓解过度拒绝问题，而R-tuning会放大该问题；拒绝能力可能与答案质量存在冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对RALM系统中重要因素影响的更全面理解，开发了简单有效的拒绝方法来提高整体答案质量，为缓解模型幻觉问题提供了新见解。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索机制，经常导致检索到不相关或冗余信息，从而降低系统性能和效率。

Method: 提出五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算管理，实现细粒度控制和任务依赖的过滤适配。

Result: 在知识密集型QA任务上评估，相比标准RAG实现，在Wikipedia数据集上减少57%上下文使用，在HotpotQA数据集上减少75%上下文使用。

Conclusion: MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用提供了框架，通过精炼和蒸馏上下文信息，实现了更好的基础支持和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

Motivation: 研究动机是探索不同历史时期和组织背景下社区工会主义的连续性和普遍性，验证现代NLP技术在历史劳工档案研究中的应用价值。

Method: 采用BERTopic主题建模和cTF-IDF权重算法，结合词频分析方法，对国家靠靴工会（1920年代）和Unite Community（2010-2020年代）进行语境对比分析。

Result: 研究发现两个工会在主题关注和词汇一致性上存在显著差异。Unite Community更多关注外向型社会正义主题，而靠靴工会更偏重内部管理、产业关系和成员服务，体现传统服务型工会模式。

Conclusion: 虽然两个工会都涉及社区相关主题，但它们的参与模式存在显著差异，这挖战了社区工会主义在不同时期和行业中具有连续性和普遍性的假设。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在大规模数据训练中往往捕获的是伪相关性而非真正的因果关系，导致在分布外场景下性能不佳，需要有效利用因果知识进行预测和生成。

Method: 提出CAT方法：1）利用人类先验自动生成token级因果信号；2）引入Re-Attention机制指导训练，使模型关注因果结构同时减轻注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game基准测试和多个下游任务上，该方法有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功将因果知识注入LLMs的注意力机制，显著提升了模型在因果推理和OOD场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和调用API，需要更好的方法来理解API依赖关系和执行顺序。

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图，构建专家标注的API图数据集In-N-Out，并利用该数据集进行模型微调。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成的性能几乎翻倍，微调模型能够填补90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在RLHF后往往表现出过度自信，生成看似合理但错误的答案，这给可靠的uncertainty estimation和安全部署带来挑战

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，从LLM多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层间信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，获得更精确的置信度评分

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有基线方法，大幅提升了校准性能

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态进行自评估校准，为模型不确定性估计提供了更可靠的方法，有助于LLM的安全部署

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of

### [96] [Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01606)
*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，句子嵌入空间中的几何距离并不能预测不同嵌入方法在具体任务上的性能表现，语言信息是通过维度的加权组合编码的，而非简单的几何相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究句子嵌入空间中的几何距离是否能够反映不同句子嵌入方法在语言任务上的性能相关性，验证"嵌入空间距离近表示语义相似"这一假设在句子级别是否成立。

Method: 采用三种句子嵌入方法：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记嵌入和随机词嵌入，计算这些嵌入变体之间的距离，并分析其与各种语言任务性能的相关性。

Result: 结果显示余弦相似度只能捕获句子嵌入之间的浅层共性和差异，这些几何特征无法预测具体任务性能。语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的。

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能有效预测嵌入方法在语言任务上的相对性能，语言信息的编码方式比简单的几何距离更为复杂和深层。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的检测大语言模型生成现代诗歌的基准框架，并通过实验证明当前检测器无法可靠识别AI生成的现代诗歌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成文本与人类写作已难以区分。现代诗歌具有独特特征，AI生成诗歌的流行严重干扰了诗歌生态系统，异常需要检测方法。

Method: 首先构建了高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人写的800首诗歌和4个主流LLM生成的41,600首诗歌。然后系统性评估了6个检测器在这个数据集上的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示当前检测器无法作为可靠工具检测LLM生成的现代诗歌。最难检测的诗歌特征是内在品质，尤其是风格。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础，证明了所提出基准框架的有效性和必要性。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransGAT是一种结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络的新型自动作文评分方法，通过双流预测机制在分析性评分维度上取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动评分方法存在静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义、忽视具体写作维度分析等问题。

Method: 将微调Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与GAT配对，第一流生成篇章级预测，第二流基于句法依赖关系构建图结构处理token嵌入，最后融合双流预测。

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，可推动自动作文评分系统发展。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Result: 成功实现了高效的语音相似度计算，GPU实现带来显著性能提升，验证了该方法在语言语音结构分析中的可行性和有效性

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效分析语言的语音相似性结构，具有扩展到其他语言的潜力，为语音学分析提供了有效的计算工具

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出InSide模型，通过图神经网络联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征），容易陷入表面模式检测，在动态环境中性能有限。需要从意图角度深入理解新闻欺骗的内在思想

Method: 提出基于图的意图-语义联合建模（InSide），将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构，通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互，采用粗到细的意图建模，并开发动态路径图对齐策略

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了所提InSide方法相比最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: 通过联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，能够更深入地理解新闻欺骗的内在机制，显著提升假新闻检测性能

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT，一个针对阿尔及利亚方言形态特点的字符级预训练语言模型，通过处理孤立单词而非传统分词序列来应对该方言复杂的形态变化、代码转换和多脚本挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态、频繁的代码转换、多脚本使用和来自其他语言的词汇影响使得传统词级或子词级方法效果有限，需要专门针对其形态特点的解决方案。

Method: 开发字符级预训练语言模型chDzDT，在孤立单词上进行训练，不依赖分词边界或标准化拼写。训练语料来自YouTube评论、法语/英语/柏柏尔语维基百科和Tatoeba项目，涵盖多脚本和语言变体。

Result: 构建了阿尔及利亚方言的多语言词典数据集，开发了形态学聚焦的字符级编码器，证明字符级建模对于形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为形态丰富的低资源方言提供了有效的字符级建模方案，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

*Andong Hua,Kenan Tang,Chenhe Gu,Jindong Gu,Eric Wong,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性主要是评估方法造成的假象，而非模型本身缺陷。使用LLM作为评判者时，性能方差显著降低，模型排名更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的提示词敏感性现象，探究这是否是LLM的固有弱点，还是评估过程的人为假象。

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型（包括GPT和Gemini系列）在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12个不同的提示模板，对比启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法。

Result: 发现提示词敏感性主要源于启发式评估方法（如对数似然评分和严格答案匹配），这些方法经常忽略语义正确但表达方式不同的回答。使用LLM评判者后，性能方差大幅减少，模型排名相关性更高。

Conclusion: 现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的要强，提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷。

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI面试官系统在定量和定性研究中收集数据的适用性，以确定其是否能够替代或补充传统的交互式语音响应(IVR)系统。

Method: 从两个维度评估AI面试官系统：输入/输出性能(语音识别、答案记录、情感处理)和语言推理能力(探询、清楚化、分支逻辑处理)，并通过现场研究进行实证分析。

Result: 现场研究显示AI面试官已经在定量和定性数据收集方面超过IVR系统，但存在实时转写错误率、有限的情感检测能力和不均匀的跟进质量等问题。

Conclusion: 当前AI面试官技术的有用性、使用和采纳可能会因定性数据收集的具体情境而异，需要根据具体应用场景进行适配性考虑。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据复杂且非结构化，传统机器学习方法难以有效提取关键患者信息，临床医生难以有效利用这些工具进行患者护理。

Method: 将任务从序列标注重构为文本生成，利用大语言模型生成推理步骤模拟医生认知过程，整合语义相似度度量（如BERT Score）来评估生成文本与临床意图的对齐程度。

Result: 该方法在医疗信息提取方面取得了显著进展，提供了可扩展的解决方案，提高了从EHRs中提取信息的准确性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于临床医生做出更明智的决策，改善患者护理结果，为医疗保健领域AI应用提供了重要进步。

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗主诉记录存在多种录入方式和医学术语变体，难以在不同医疗机构间标准化，给病历记录和文本挖掘带来困难。

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标注（实体提及和类别标签），然后基于BERT模型训练实体识别和本体链接，完全无需人工标注。

Result: 在120万条真实去标识化主诉记录上的实验表明，该方法在无人工标注情况下性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 弱监督实体提取和链接方法能够有效解决医疗主诉标准化问题，为医疗文本挖掘提供了可行的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决各领域（如保险、域名）的争议通常需要人工法官处理，但过程耗时且复杂，需要探索LLMs作为辅助工具来提高争议解决效率。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，首先识别争议的关键结构要素并生成结构化摘要，然后使用多种提示策略和多LLMs在三个层次（整体优势方判断、具体需求评估、论据强度分析）上进行争议解决。

Result: 通过比较相关基线和合适的评估指标，评估了LLMs在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的争议解决辅助工具，特别是在结构化和多层次的争议分析方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，在细微语义区分方面存在困难。需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别

Method: 1) 双图编码器通过依存解析和主题建模构建语义图，使用图同构网络传播结构特征；2) 分层对比目标在多个粒度上实施一致性：节点级对比正则化和图感知对比学习

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法，在法律法规匹配上达到86.7% F1分数（绝对提升6.2%）

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结合结构推理和对比学习，有效解决了文本语义匹配中的结构模式和语义区分问题，在多个应用场景中展现出优异性能

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗保健领域具有变革潜力，但其解释纵向患者叙述的能力尚未得到充分探索。牙科领域拥有丰富的结构化临床数据，为评估LLM的推理能力提供了独特机会。

Method: 使用34个标准化纵向牙周病例（包含258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估模型性能。采用自动化指标和持牌牙医的盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek成为表现最佳的模型，显示出更高的忠实度（中位数得分0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457）和更高的专家评分（中位数4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: 研究将DeepSeek定位为病例分析的领先LLM，支持其作为辅助工具在医学教育和研究中的整合，并突显其作为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

across three subtasks: spoken dialect identification (Subtask 1), speech
recognition (Subtask 2), and diacritic restoration for spoken dialects (Subtask
3). A total of 44 teams registered, and during the testing phase, 100 valid
submissions were received from eight unique teams. The distribution was as
follows: 34 submissions for Subtask 1 "five teams{\ae}, 47 submissions for
Subtask 2 "six teams", and 19 submissions for Subtask 3 "two teams". The
best-performing systems achieved 79.8% accuracy on Subtask 1, 35.68/12.20
WER/CER (overall average) on Subtask 2, and 55/13 WER/CER on Subtask 3. These
results highlight the ongoing challenges of Arabic dialect speech processing,
particularly in dialect identification, recognition, and diacritic restoration.
We also summarize the methods adopted by participating teams and briefly
outline directions for future editions of NADI.

*Guangzeng Han,Weisi Liu,Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt结合遗传算法和LLM，通过基因交叉和变异操作生成高质量、多样化的合成数据，在多个NLP任务中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成合成数据时质量和多样性不足的问题，使合成数据分布更接近真实世界数据。

Method: 将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作，并集成主动学习方案优化父代选择。

Result: 在多个NLP任务中显著超越最先进基线，在不同模型规模下表现稳健，合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生成高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 指令微调显著提升大语言模型的长度控制能力，主要通过深层网络组件的专业化实现，不同语言采用不同的补偿机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在精确字数控制文本生成方面的挑战，比较基础模型与指令微调模型在英语和意大利语中的表现差异。

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，重点关注不同层级的注意力头和MLP。

Result: 指令微调大幅改善长度控制，深层注意力头在英语中贡献显著增加，意大利语中最终层MLP发挥更强补偿作用。

Conclusion: 指令微调通过重新配置深层网络实现任务遵循，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行适应性调整。

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: CRPO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过对比推理和检索增强的方法，利用高质量和低质量提示的对比来优化LLM提示生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽略了利用LLMs固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架，从HelpSteer2数据集中检索参考提示，构建两种优化范式：分层对比推理和多维度对比推理

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 对比性、检索增强的推理方法在自动提示优化方面具有广阔前景

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在与目标交互有限、难度控制不足、评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 提出JudgeAgent框架，采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个步骤进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架解决了传统LLM评估方法的局限性，为精确评估大语言模型的知识和能力边界提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了共模态检索增强生成（CMRAG）方法，通过同时利用文本和图像信息来改进多模态文档问答任务，显著优于纯视觉方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析和文本提取的方法只能利用显式文本信息，无法处理图像内容；而基于视觉语言模型的方法忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不理想。

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析，获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示；然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，并在跨模态检索层面聚合结果；最后提示视觉语言模型基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉基础的RAG方法。

Conclusion: 将共模态信息以统一方式整合到RAG框架中是提高复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AMBEDKAR框架，通过宪法感知解码层和推测解码算法，在推理时减少LLM中的种姓和宗教偏见，无需更新模型参数，实现了高达26.41%的偏见减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境下，种姓和宗教偏见尤为突出。现有缓解策略多为西方中心化，无法处理这些本地化细微差别。

Method: 基于印度宪法第14-17条的平等愿景，设计了宪法感知解码层，采用推测解码算法，在推理时通过小型语言模型生成、大型语言模型验证的方式主动减少偏见。

Result: 相比基线方法，该方法实现了高达26.41%的绝对偏见减少，且无需重新训练模型，降低了计算和基础设施成本。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架成功地将推测解码重新诠释为公平性机制，为处理本地化社会偏见提供了有效的解决方案，同时保持了模型效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在低资源语言命名实体识别任务中，使用小规模解码器语言模型结合元学习的方法，以替代传统的大规模多语言模型微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务中大规模多语言模型在内存和延迟受限环境下的不可行性问题，探索小模型能否通过预训练实现快速适应和零样本跨语言迁移。

Method: 使用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替代部分自回归目标进行预训练，在Tagalog和Cebuano语言上进行测试，这两种语言在类型学上相似但在结构上存在差异。

Result: 在四种模型规模（11M-570M）下，MAML方法在仅头部调优时提升零样本micro-F1分数2-6个百分点，在全模型调优时提升1-3个百分点，同时收敛时间减少最多8%。

Conclusion: 元学习方法有效提升了小模型在低资源语言NER任务中的性能，特别是在与表面锚点（如Tagalog格助词si/ni）共现的单标记人名实体上表现最佳，证明了表面锚点的重要性。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

TL;DR: 提出Avoidance Decoding解码策略，通过惩罚与先前生成内容的相似性来提升LLM生成内容的多样性，减少重复性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在相同输入提示下往往生成重复单调的输出，特别是在故事生成等任务中缺乏创意多样性

Method: Avoidance Decoding策略，通过概念级相似性惩罚和叙事级相似性惩罚来修改token logits，早期优先概念多样性，后期强调叙事多样性

Result: 相比强基线方法，输出多样性提升2.6倍，重复性平均减少30%，同时有效缓解文本退化问题，激活了更广泛的神经元

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了LLM生成内容的多样性，证明了能够有效利用模型内在创造力，为文本生成任务提供了新的解码策略

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Conclusion: FActBench为医学领域提供了有效的事实检查基准，一致投票方法能够更好地反映模型的事实准确性表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出基础语言模型(FLM)范式，主张使用小型语言能力强的模型配合外部工具进行事实检索，而非单一大型模型同时处理语言能力和事实记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在幻觉、偏见、隐私问题和计算成本高等限制，这些问题源于语言能力和事实记忆在单一模型中的结合。

Method: 评估了从135M到32B参数规模的模型在三个维度上的表现：语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识。

Result: 研究发现虽然语言能力和事实知识都随规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力的关系比与核心语言能力的关系更密切。

Conclusion: FLM范式支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基础，为更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案提供了路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能够不仅推断人类思维模式，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点，特别是团队成员在共享理解方面的差异

Method: 提出两步框架：第一步使用LLM对任务导向对话进行共享心智模型元素标注；第二步使用另一个LLM比较LLM标注与人工标注的差异，检测并描述分歧

Result: 创建了包含人工和LLM标注的数据集，建立了可复现的SMM一致性评估框架，发现LLM在简单自然语言标注任务中表现良好，但在需要空间推理或语音线索消歧的场景中系统性地出错

Conclusion: 虽然大语言模型在基础自然语言处理任务中表现出明显的一致性，但在需要复杂推理的场景中仍存在局限性，特别是在空间推理和语音线索理解方面

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

TL;DR: DCPO提出动态剪切策略和平滑优势标准化技术，解决RLVR框架中的零梯度问题，在多个模型和测试集上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在零梯度问题，主要由于固定的标识级概率比剪切边界和相同奖励的标准化导致。这会造成效果不佳的梯度更新和生成响应的利用不充分。

Method: 提出动态剪切策略优化（DCPO）：1）动态剪切策略：根据标识特定先验概率自适应地调整剪切边界，提升标识级探索能力；2）平滑优势标准化：在累计训练步骤中标准化奖励，提高响应级利用效率。

Result: DCPO在4个基于4个不同模型的测试集上达到最佳性能：在AIME24测试集上（Qwen2.5-Math-7B），Avg@1为46.7（贪婪解码），Avg@32为38.8（32次采样），超过DAPO和GRPO。在AIME25测试集上（Qwen2.5-14B），性能为23.3/19.0，同样超过对手。非零优势比GRPO提升28%，训练效率比DAPO提高一倍，标识剪切比率显著降低。

Conclusion: DCPO通过动态剪切和平滑标准化技术，有效解决了RLVR框架中的零梯度问题，显著提升了大语言模型在强化学习中对生成数据的利用效率，并在多个测试集上展现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Conclusion: 本论文填补了对LLM内部推理机制专门研究的空白，为隐式推理技术提供了一个系统的分析框架和评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLM基于预处理与细调阿拉伯transformer模型以及集成学习相结合的研究，为阿拉伯社交远程医疗数据的疾病分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

TL;DR: EmoPerso是一个自监督框架，通过情感感知建模改进人格检测，利用生成机制进行数据增强和表示学习，通过多任务学习和交叉注意力模块捕捉人格与情感的细粒度交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：1）利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表示学习；2）提取伪标签情感特征并通过多任务学习与人格预测联合优化；3）使用交叉注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感表征的细粒度交互；4）采用自学习策略迭代增强模型推理能力。

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模和自监督学习有效解决了人格检测中的数据标注依赖问题，并成功捕捉了人格与情感之间的相互作用，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在任务处理中并不总是有效整合外部标签定义，更多依赖内部参数化知识，特别是在通用任务中，而领域特定任务能更好利用外部定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否真正整合外部定义还是主要依赖其参数化知识，以理解模型如何处理外部知识与内部能力的关系。

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行控制实验，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义条件。

Result: 显式标签定义能提高准确性和可解释性，但LLM对其整合不一致且不保证，模型经常默认使用内部表示，特别是在通用任务中。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLM如何处理外部知识与预训练能力的关系，外部定义的整合效果因任务类型而异。

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

TL;DR: 一个自动化案底框架，用于审计基础模型是否遵守开发商的行为指南，发现主要模型存在20%的遵循问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型开发商虽然发布了行为指南，但并不清楚模型是否真正遵循这些规定，需要系统性的审计方法来验证

Method: 通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示、使用模型作为判官来评估遵循情况，重点考察开发商规范、模型输出和模型判官之间的三方一致性

Result: 在16个模型和100多个行为声明的审计中，发现了系统性的不一致性，最高达20%的遵循缺口

Conclusion: 基础模型并非完全遵循开发商的行为指南，需要更严格的审计和监管机制来确保模型行为与声称的一致性

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Motivation: 当前奖励模型严重依赖大规模标注偏好数据，而现有预训练方法无法在奖励模型中注入明确的推理能力

Method: 采用自训练方法利用未标注数据激发奖励推理，开发GRAM-R²生成式奖励模型，既能产生偏好标签又能生成奖励理由

Result: 在响应排序、任务适应和人类反馈强化学习等实验中，GRAM-R² consistently outperforms several strong discriminative and generative baselines

Conclusion: GRAM-R²可作为奖励推理的基础模型，支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对滥用的担忧，现有方法忽视风格建模且依赖静态阈值，限制了检测性能

Method: MoSEs包含三个核心组件：风格参考库(SRR)、风格感知路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)，通过动态确定最优阈值进行检测

Result: 相比基线方法平均提升11.34%的检测性能，在低资源情况下提升39.15%

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格感知的条件阈值估计，有效提升了AI生成文本检测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源印度语言中语义评估的挑战，由于缺乏高质量基准测试，句子转换器在这些语言中的效果尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10种印度语言和英语的头条识别数据集，每篇文章配有四种头条变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、不相关），使用余弦相似度评估多种句子转换器模型。

Result: 多语言模型表现一致良好，而特定语言模型的效果各不相同，为RAG管道中的语义理解评估提供了宝贵资源。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了印度语言语义评估的空白，可作为多功能基准用于多种NLP任务，并公开分享以促进低资源语言NLP研究。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared
publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

TL;DR: 本研究通过AI技术重现了1929年Federico Pucci发明的基于规则的机械翻译系统，验证了该历史方法的有效性，并将其应用于现代多语言翻译，填补了机器翻译历史的重要空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发现和验证Federico Pucci在1929年提出的机械翻译系统，这一先驱性工作长期被忽视，通过现代AI技术证明其历史价值和在机器翻译发展史上的地位。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的原始方法重新翻译1931年文献中的两个文本片段（但丁《新生》意译法和伏尔泰《查第格》法译意），并扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译实验。

Result: 94年间使用相同方法翻译的文本差异很小，验证了Pucci系统的有效性。AI成功将该方法应用于更多现代和技术性文本的多语言翻译。

Conclusion: Pucci应被视为机器翻译的先驱者之一，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等知名人物并列，这项研究重新书写了机器翻译领域的历史认知。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

TL;DR: 提出Top-H解码方法，通过熵约束质量最大化解决LLM在开放文本生成中平衡创造性和逻辑性的问题，相比现有方法提升25.63%的创意写作性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有截断采样方法（如温度缩放、top-p、min-p采样）在平衡文本生成多样性和逻辑连贯性方面存在局限，未能有效利用模型置信度信息

Method: 建立熵约束最小散度理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化问题，提出计算高效的贪婪算法Top-H解码来解决该问题

Result: 在创意写作基准上比min-p采样提升25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K、MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性，LLM-as-judge评估确认在高温度下仍能产生连贯输出

Conclusion: Top-H解码在开放文本生成中实现了state-of-the-art性能，易于集成到创意写作应用中，有效平衡了创造性和连贯性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Result: 代码混合模型（特别是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT）表现最优，超越了包括Google Gemini在内的闭源大语言模型；非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限；Google Gemini在零样本设置下展现出有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: 专业化的代码混合模型在代码混合命名实体识别任务中效果最佳，但现代大语言模型也展现出强大的泛化能力，为专业模型与通用模型的选择提供了重要参考

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在奖励信号稀疏和策略梯度更新不稳定的问题，特别是在基于RL的方法中，需要更稳定高效的训练框架。

Method: 将RLVR问题重新表述为监督学习任务，将结果奖励视为可预测标签，通过交叉熵损失优化策略模型参数化的评分函数，实现隐式的Actor-Critic耦合。

Conclusion: PACS提供了一个简单而强大的框架，为具有可验证奖励的LLMs后训练提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Motivation: 挑战多语言ASR模型优于单语模型的传统观念，证明对于足够小的模型，精心设计的单语训练可以在资源有限的语言上实现更好的性能

Method: 使用高质量人工标注、伪标注和合成数据的平衡混合训练单语系统，模型规模为27M参数

Result: 平均错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny低48%，性能优于9倍大的Whisper Small，在大多数情况下匹配或优于28倍大的Whisper Medium

Conclusion: 这些结果推动了该规模模型的技术水平，为先前支持有限的语言实现了准确的设备端ASR，并开源发布了阿拉伯语、中文、日语、韩语、乌克兰语和越南语模型

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

### [137] [PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02550)
*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试共享任务，包含阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化两个子任务，结果显示任务特定微调显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在预训练阶段主要接触西方高资源语言和文化数据，导致对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显差距，特别是在代表性不足的主题上。

Method: 设计了包含多项选择题的两个子任务：通用阿拉伯文化和通用伊斯兰文化，涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等广泛主题。

Result: 26个团队注册子任务1，19个注册子任务2，最终分别有9个和6个有效提交。最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，在伊斯兰知识上达到84.22%。参数高效微调是最主要且最有效的方法。

Conclusion: 任务特定微调能显著提升LLMs在特定文化领域的表现，参数高效微调是主导方法，数据增强的效用具有领域依赖性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对四种口吃检测模型（YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM、SSDM）进行了系统性比较分析，从性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度评估，发现UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型在基准数据集上的性能持续提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型具有可控性和可解释性。

Method: 通过在多数据集上的综合评估和临床专家评估，系统比较四种代表性方法：YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM和SSDM。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简单性但透明度有限；UDM实现准确性和临床可解释性的最佳平衡；SSDM在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了不同方法之间的权衡关系，为临床可行的口吃建模指明了未来方向，并提供了详细的实施见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Wei Zhang,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchedCP是一个让LLM智能体自主优化Linux调度器的框架，通过解耦AI语义推理和系统执行，实现了1.79倍性能提升和13倍成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在语义鸿沟问题，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳。需要让AI能够安全高效地自主优化调度器。

Method: 采用解耦控制平面架构，将AI的语义推理（优化什么）与系统执行（如何观察和行动）分离。实现为MCP服务器，提供工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器。

Result: 实现了1.79倍的性能提升，相比简单智能体方法成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率。

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使专家级系统优化民主化，为创建真正自优化、应用感知的操作系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced
in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

TL;DR: 本研究通过从arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题，利用研究出版物的时间结构来评估大语言模型的数据污染问题，发现前沿模型在知识截止日期前后没有显著性能衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对大语言模型数据污染的担忧日益增加，需要新的评估方法来区分真正的推理能力和单纯的记忆能力。

Method: 使用无限可扩展框架从arXiv论文合成多步推理问题，利用研究出版物的自然时间结构，评估4个前沿模型在1,643个问题上的表现。

Result: 结果显示不同规模、开发者和发布日期的模型在知识截止日期附近均未出现显著性能衰减，表明多步推理要求提供了超越浅层记忆的复杂性。

Conclusion: 建议优先采用推理驱动的合成方法来构建基准测试，而不是简单地定期收集新发布的问题，并开源代码和数据集以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何整合他人语言指导与直接经验进行安全快速学习，并探索AI系统如何实现类似的社会学习能力。

Method: 建立基于联合概率推理的计算框架，将预训练语言模型转化为条件概率模型，通过贝叶斯推理处理感觉运动数据和语言输入，在视频游戏环境中进行行为实验和模拟。

Result: 语言指导能够塑造探索行为、加速学习过程，减少风险交互并促进关键发现，实现了人类与模型之间的成功知识传递。

Conclusion: 结构化、与语言兼容的表征可能实现人机协作学习，为社会学习和AI系统发展提供了新的计算框架。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

TL;DR: 提出基于熵引导的精炼方法，通过token级不确定性触发单次目标精炼，让小模型以1/3成本达到大模型95%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理模型成本高、延迟大的问题，在保证质量的同时降低推理成本

Method: 提取logprobs计算香农熵，使用OR逻辑触发器（困惑度、最大token熵、低置信度token计数），将不确定性报告反馈给模型指导修正

Result: 在技术查询任务中，小模型+精炼环达到参考推理模型95%质量，成本降低约2/3，31%响应得到选择性精炼，准确率提升16%

Conclusion: 该方法在单次推理和昂贵推理链之间提供了有效平衡，适合对质量和成本都有要求的实际部署

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

*David Freire-Obregón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过赋予不同准确度的情绪分类器来探索感知准确性对智能体情感和空间行为的影响，发现低准确度分类器导致信任降低、情感分裂和社会组织混乱，而高准确度则形成稳定的情感集群和情绪恢复力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类情绪感知准确性对社会行为的影响，通过计算模型研究情绪识别偏差如何扭曲社会过程和破坏情感整合。

Method: 在2D环面网格上部署智能体，使用基于JAFFE（差）、CK+（中）、KDEF（高）数据集训练的情绪分类器，智能体根据感知到的邻居情绪状态进行移动（趋近积极情绪，避开消极情绪）。

Result: 低准确度分类器导致信任减少、情感分裂为悲伤、社会组织混乱；高准确度分类器形成坚韧的情感集群和情绪恢复力；即使在情绪中性场景中，误感知也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社会过程并破坏情感整合，强调了准确情绪感知对社会凝聚力的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在重要决策中扮演更重要的角色，需要确保其与人类价值观对齐。依赖专有API限制了研究的可复现性和广泛参与

Method: 使用本地开源模型进行集成辩论，跨越150场辩论、15个场景和5种集成配置，使用7点评分量表进行评估

Result: 集成模型在7点评分量表上整体表现优于单模型基准（3.48 vs 3.13），在真实性和人类增强方面提升最大（分别+1.25和+0.80分）

Conclusion: 集成辩论为基于集成的对齐评估提供了可访问和可复现的基础，证明了开源模型集成在提升AI对齐能力方面的有效性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由检索替代传统的向量数据库检索，特别适用于小型领域特定语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成方法依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器，对于小型领域特定语料库来说过于复杂和资源密集。

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序。

Result: 在HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库（100-500个文本块）上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超越密集检索基线，同时减少端到端检索时间。

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了一个实用的解决方案，特别注重简单性、速度和主题聚焦。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主AI系统评估仍以技术指标为主，缺乏人本中心和经济维度的监测方法，需要开发更全面的监控算法来识别系统异常。

Method: 提出适应性多维监控(AMDM)算法：包括异质指标标准化、每个维度的指数加权移动平均阈值、以及通过马哇拉比距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: 在模拟实验中，AMDM将异常检测延迟从12.3秒降低到5.6秒，并将误报率从4.5%降至0.9%，显著超越了静态阈值方法。

Conclusion: AMDM算法为自主AI系统提供了有效的多维度监控方案，能够更早期发现系统异常，为高风险领域的AI部署提供了重要的安全保障。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Motivation: 传统RLVF依赖稀疏的结果奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率

Method: 提出Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE)算法，在线评估任务难度并基于模型自信心动态调整内在奖励

Result: 在AIME和MATH数学推理基准测试中显著超越强基线，获得更高准确率和更鲁棒的测试时计算扩展性能

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够促进有效探索而不牺牲精度，验证了利用模型自信心指导强化学习的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Conclusion: HARP工具为医疗资源规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算不确定条件下实现人口覆盖最大化和地区公平性目标

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Motivation: 研究动机是将个体层面的证据基础信念和可错知识扩展到群体层面，探索群体知识和信念的形式化逻辑框架。

Method: 采用拓扑语义方法，将个体证据模型扩展到多智能体系统，构建群体证据逻辑，并引入动态证据共享算子进行扩展。

Result: 完全公理化了群体证据逻辑（包括硬证据和软证据），证明了其可判定性，特别对群体知识和信念逻辑片段进行了完整处理，并证明动态扩展与静态基础具有相同的表达能力。

Conclusion: 成功建立了群体证据逻辑的完整形式化框架，证明了其良好的逻辑性质（可判定性、可公理化），动态证据共享操作不会增加表达力，为多智能体系统中的群体认知研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理系统都是硬编码的，使用固定的研究策略和工具，缺乏灵活性和通用性。

Method: 开发了Universal Deep Research (UDR)系统，包装任何语言模型，提供用户界面让用户创建和优化自定义研究策略，展示了最小化、扩展性和密集型三种示例策略。

Result: UDR系统展示了通用性，能够支持多种不同的研究策略，并通过用户界面促进系统实验。

Conclusion: UDR提供了一个灵活通用的框架，使用户能够根据自己的需求定制深度研究策略，突破了现有系统的硬编码限制。

Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形技术，让LLM能够在运行时通过反思和用户反馈动态更新指令，无需检索或微调即可实现知识更新，显著提升性能和减少幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在预训练后的静态性问题，避免RAG的高延迟和工程开销、提示工程的脆弱性以及微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 使用精心设计的系统指令作为外部可审计的伪参数，通过反思引擎分析对话痕迹，提出类型化增量更新(ΔS, ΔU, ΔT)，并通过版本控制和评分机制进行管理，最终将成熟的指令空间增益蒸馏到参数中

Result: 在企业支持场景中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，审计幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud概念验证中，每小时处理工单数提升4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，可推广到需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域（法律、医疗、工程）

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

TL;DR: SHERPA是一个基于分层状态机的模型驱动框架，通过将领域特定最佳实践显式编码到状态机中，来提升大语言模型在复杂任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能力强大，但缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务上。现有的多步提示方法缺乏通用的行为控制机制。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机来结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则或机器学习（包括LLM）的方法实现细粒度行为控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多个任务上验证了SHERPA的有效性，相比无状态机的基线方法显著提升了输出质量，特别适用于具有成熟人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务。

Conclusion: 通过将领域最佳实践编码到状态机中，SHERPA框架为LLM提供了更精细的行为控制机制，显著提升了复杂任务的处理性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

TL;DR: SIGMUS系统利用大语言模型整合城市多模态传感器数据，自动构建知识图谱来识别和推理城市事件，无需依赖人工规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市传感器产生大量多模态数据，但数据分散且难以整合，需要人工推理来识别事件与多模态数据间的关系，限制了事件识别和预测能力。

Method: 开发SIGMUS系统，使用大语言模型生成世界知识，自动识别城市事件与多模态数据间的关系，构建组织事件、观测数据等的知识图谱。

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS系统成功实现了城市多模态数据的语义集成，为自动事件识别和预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Motivation: 当前行业中的自主数字代理（如Manus AI和Gemini研究模式）在结构化任务中展现出潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，要求代理根据写作指令和原始数据，识别叙事视角、执行关键词查询、检索历史背景并生成完整新闻文章。基准包含6000个从真实新闻转换的多模态内容示例。

Result: 评估显示代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面存在困难。开源和闭源LLM在常用代理框架下的表现表明当前系统仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了一个现实测试平台，有助于推动自主代理在真实世界生产力应用中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了刺槐豆胶、瓜尔胶、麦芽糊精和卡拉胶对自制冰淇淋融化行为的影响，通过融化测试和计算机视觉分析评估了这些稳定剂的融化抗性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰淇淋在融化过程中的稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要研究不同稳定剂对融化行为的影响并寻找更具成本效益的配方。

Method: 制备含不同添加剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气室基质；重新冷冻后再次融化的样品显示出更强的结构稳定性；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过评估性能和成本，证明了开发平衡耐用性和经济效益的配方的潜力，对小型和商业冰淇淋生产具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Motivation: 传统静态提示工程和孤立代理模拟存在局限性，需要一种动态的协同进化框架来实现可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体人工智能。

Method: 1) 用户与LLM形成认知二元组构建子类大脑；2) GA辅助的前向-后向进化迭代优化；3) 多子类大脑通过群体智能协调；4) 标准化行为整合为超类大脑。

Result: 提出了理论框架和初步实现（如无人机调度、关键词过滤），建立了跨二元组知识整合的注册机制。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够直觉地模拟未言明的社会动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在这方面存在困难，需要更好的结构化表示方法来处理隐式社会情境

Method: 采用POMDP驱动设计，将社会互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、智能体行为、心理状态），可从自由形式叙述中自动推导

Result: 在5个社会推理任务中显著提升性能（如FANToM心理理论推理+51%），在SOTOPIA社会互动基准上提升达+18%

Conclusion: S3AP作为一种通用的社会世界状态表示形式具有巨大潜力，能够开发出更具社会意识的系统来更好地导航社会互动

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多模态时间序列预测方法存在模态不平衡问题，往往过度强调文本模态而忽视时间序列模态，导致信息丢失和预测性能下降。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列数据，同时将时间序列的描述性统计信息输入大语言模型生成文本嵌入。通过缩放策略和对比目标实现跨模态平衡对齐，最后将对齐后的文本语义嵌入和时间序列嵌入整合进行预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BALM-TSF以最少的可训练参数实现了长期和少样本预测的最先进性能，证明了其有效利用文本和时间序列互补信息的能力。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF通过平衡的多模态对齐机制成功解决了模态不平衡问题，为LLM-based时间序列预测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从多样化真实网络环境中收集流量数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具脆弱且成本高昂，无法满足多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率的要求。

Method: 用户通过自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作的工作流，系统将其编译为非确定性有限自动机(NFA)，再通过状态合成转换为可重用、可执行的代码，支持确定性重放和状态缓存减少LLM调用。

Result: 实验自动化了50+个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网页抓取等领域，生成了真实流量轨迹，并对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent结合了基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的数据集提供了可扩展基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Conclusion: 模块化架构与形式化知识表示能够通过计算高效模型使复杂法律推理更易实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为未来更透明、可信、有效的法律AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

Result: 在两个全模态大语言模型上的实验表明，OmniDPO有效减少多模态幻觉并显著提升跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和模态关联问题，成功改善了多模态基础能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化上下文注入框架，通过系统地在输入中嵌入任务特定信息来指导LLM解决图问题，无需微调即可获得性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图推理任务对LLM具有挑战性，需要将任务映射到概念基础表示，但通过微调或多步查询的方式成本高昂且效率低下

Method: 结构化上下文注入方法，将任务特定信息直接嵌入输入中，使LLM能够隐式地将任务与基础概念空间对齐

Result: 在多个图任务上评估显示性能一致提升，结构化输入上下文可以媲美或超越更复杂的方法

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是LLM图理解的有效且可扩展策略，在准确性和计算成本之间提供了良好权衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

TL;DR: L-MARS是一个多智能体法律问答系统，通过协调推理和搜索减少幻觉，在LegalSearchQA基准上显著提升准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在法律问答中的幻觉和不确定性问题，需要更精确的法律检索和验证机制

Method: 将查询分解为子问题，在多个异构源（网络搜索、本地RAG、案例法）进行定向搜索，使用法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性

Result: 在200个最新法律选择题的基准测试中，L-MARS显著提高事实准确性，减少不确定性，获得人类专家和LLM法官的更高偏好评分

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与智能搜索为高风险领域部署LLM提供了可扩展且可复现的蓝图，特别适用于需要精确法律检索和审议的场景

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠高效的大型推理模型的实用路径

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中的优化面临两个挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均方方差优化，开发迭代算法通过不断更新风险敏感参数来求解，并设计了策略迭代过程。

Result: 提出的算法能够单调递增地收敛到最优夏普比率，在平均和折现MDP设置下都证明了收敛性，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是第一个使用动态规划类型算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度学习模型在业务过程管理中进行后缀预测时，经常无法满足基本的逻辑约束，因为缺乏领域知识的显式集成。

Method: 提出了一种可微分的逻辑损失函数，使用软近似的LTLf语义和Gumbel-Softmax技巧，可以与标准预测损失结合使用。还提出了局部和全局两种逻辑损失变体。

Result: 在三个实际数据集上的实验评估显示，该方法提高了后缀预测的准确性和对时态约束的遵循程度。

Conclusion: 该框架虽然在BPM背景下开发，但适用于任何符号序列生成任务，并为推进神经符号AI做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中闭环胰岛素输送系统(CLIDS)的采用率低，主要不是技术失败，而是由于行为、心理和社会障碍。需要评估LLM在健康行为改变说服对话中的有效性。

Method: 创建ChatCLIDS基准框架，包含专家验证的虚拟患者库（具有临床基础的异质性特征和现实采纳障碍），模拟与配备多样化循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮交互，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景。

Result: 研究发现，虽然更大、更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社会压力下。

Conclusion: 结果突显了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性，为推进医疗保健及其他领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCCFR与深度神经网络结合时面临规模依赖的挑战，包括非平稳目标分布偏移、动作支持崩溃、方差爆炸和热启动偏差等问题，这些问题在不同规模游戏中表现不同。

Method: 提出Robust Deep MCCFR框架，包含延迟更新的目标网络、均匀探索混合、方差感知训练目标和全面诊断监控，通过系统消融研究验证组件有效性。

Result: 在Kuhn扑克上最终可剥削性达到0.0628（比经典框架提升60%），在Leduc扑克上达到0.2386（提升23.5%），证明了选择性组件使用的重要性。

Conclusion: 神经MCCFR组件的有效性具有规模依赖性，需要针对不同游戏规模采用不同的缓解策略，选择性组件部署比全面缓解更有效。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型逻辑推理评估工具缺乏可控性和可扩展性，无法进行多维度系统分析，问题类型和格式也较为单一。

Method: SATQuest从合取范式(CNF)实例生成满足性问题，沿三个正交维度(实例规模、问题类型、问题格式)构建问题，采用随机化SAT问题生成和基于PySAT的客观答案验证。

Result: 评估发现大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在显著局限，特别是在超越熟悉数学格式的泛化能力上。使用SATQuest奖励进行强化微调能显著提升目标任务性能并泛化到更复杂实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进大语言模型逻辑推理能力的有价值起点，同时揭示了跨格式适应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Method: 结合符号程序合成与大型语言模型(LLMs)，通过神经摘要技术自动生成逻辑程序的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: 为构建支持人类学习的有效USML系统奠定了坚实基础，但需要进一步研究如何优化解释内容以真正促进人类学习。

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

Motivation: 现有方法（如测试时扩展、监督微调、强化学习）在LLM性能提升上会出现收益递减，需要开发新的推理技术来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用通用符号推理（General Symbolics）方法，构建CoreThink通用符号推理器（GSR），专门针对工具调用、代码生成和规划三个关键用例进行结构化设计。

Result: 在7个基准测试中表现优异：Livecodebench v6达到66.66%、Instruction-Following Evals达到89%、ARC-AGI-2达到24.4%，基于该技术的智能编码IDE在SWE-Bench Lite上达到62.3%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层能够提供纯粹的性能提升，确保模型在推理任务上的准确性不会受到负面影响，为推理密集型用例提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Conclusion: 数据系统需要从根本上重新设计以原生支持LLM代理工作负载，利用代理推测的特性可以开启数据系统架构的新研究机遇

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,

Method: 构建FlashAdventure测试案例集（44款Flash冒险游戏），提出CUA-as-a-Judge自动评估器，以及COAST框架（利用长期线索记忆来策划和解决序列任务）

Result: 当前GUI代理在完整故事线完成上表现局限，COAST通过缩小观察-行为间隔提高了里程碑完成率，但与人类仍有显著差距

Conclusion: 该研究为GUI代理在冒险游戏中的完整故事线完成提供了重要测试案例，COAST框架显示了解决观察-行为间隔问题的潜力，但人机差距仍需进一步研究

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: 通过系统设计原则提供：上游与VeRL对齐、统一工具管理、异步rollout执行（实现近2倍加速）、模块化插件架构。

Result: 在6个ARLT领域（数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索、软件工程）实现竞争性性能，与专用系统相当。

Conclusion: VerlTool提供了一个可扩展的基础设施，显著降低了开发开销，为工具增强的强化学习研究提供了统一训练基础设施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

TL;DR: Robix是一个统一模型，将机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互集成到单一视觉语言架构中，作为分层机器人系统的高层认知层，能够动态生成原子命令和语言响应，支持复杂指令执行、长时程任务规划和自然人类交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人在复杂环境中执行多阶段任务、处理实时中断以及与人类自然交互的挑战，需要开发一个端到端的统一框架，整合推理、规划和交互能力。

Method: 采用三阶段训练策略：1）持续预训练增强基础具身推理能力；2）监督微调将人机交互和任务规划建模为统一推理-动作序列；3）强化学习提高推理-动作一致性和长时程任务连贯性。核心使用思维链推理。

Result: 实验表明Robix在交互式任务执行方面优于开源和商业基线（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），在多样化指令类型（开放式、多阶段、约束、无效和中断指令）和各种用户参与任务（如餐桌清理、购物、饮食过滤）上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix成功实现了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互的统一集成，通过创新的三阶段训练策略和思维链推理，显著提升了机器人在复杂环境中的交互式任务执行能力，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers

Conclusion: 通过重用检索推理而非重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率间取得平衡，为产品集成提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法通常假设锚点实体可访问来启动图遍历，这在开放世界环境中不可靠，限制了方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，在真实世界问答任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作有效解决了开放世界RAG中的锚点实体依赖问题，提高了检索鲁棒性并减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的效果，相比传统的执行最佳选择(ex-BoN)和多数投票(Maj)方法，ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准测试中取得了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略如BoN和Maj依赖表面启发式方法，而基于语义正确性的ORMs方法在Text-to-SQL任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务ORMs的框架，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上微调多个开源LLM（Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等），评估ORMs作为BoN启发式的有效性。

Result: ORMs在BIRD上比ex-BoN提升4.33%，比Maj提升2.91%；在Spider上比ex-BoN提升2.10%，比Maj提升0.93%。对已对齐SQL生成的模型（如OmniSQL）微调可获得更优的ORM性能。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中优于传统ex-BoN和Maj方法的有效策略，特别是在复杂查询和更多候选查询的情况下表现更佳，为提升LLM的SQL生成准确性提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QPM方法在处理多模态动态系统时过于保守，无法提供模式特定的满意度信息，需要一种能够处理多模态动态的方法

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型近似系统概率多模态动态，通过模式分类器划分轨迹，对每个模式应用保形推理生成统计有效的模式特定预测区间

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模式无关基线显著更信息丰富（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM通过结合深度生成模型和模式分类，有效解决了多模态动态系统的定量预测监控问题，提供了更精确的模式特定预测

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需额外训练的CAD零件组件检索框架，通过错误笔记本和RAG技术改善现有大模型的检索性能，在GPT-4o上实现了23.4%的绝对准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLMs/VLMs进行CAD组件检索遇到两大挑战：输入序列超出模型令牌限制，且性能不佳；同时对于高性能专有模型细调需要大量计算资源且访问受限。

Method: 提出一种无需额外训练的框架，使用错误笔记本(Error Notebooks)+检索增强生成(RAG)进行精细提示工程。错误笔记本构建包括收集历史错误思考链和通过反思纠正连接它们直到获得正确解决方案。RAG用于从错误笔记本中检索规范相关记录并将其整合到推理过程中。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列专有模型上进行实验，显示出显著的性能提升，GPT-4o(Omni)在人类偏好数据集上实现了绝对23.4%的准确率提升。消融研究确认思考链推理在零件数量较多(>10)的挑战性场景中特别有效。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理包含长序列非自然语言元数据的3D模型，为自动化设计验证和下游工程任务提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案，具有重要的工程应用价值。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以收集真正反映研究人员关注点和知识好奇心的前沿研究问题，评估深度研究智能体的研究能力具有挑战性。现有基准无法很好地反映真实研究环境和避免数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出多智能体分层任务生成(MAHTG)系统，从学术研讨会记录中提取研究灵感并转化为高质量研究任务，确保任务制定的可追溯性和噪声过滤。

Result: 构建了包含12个学科、200多场学术研讨会、超过10,000个高质量研究任务的DeepResearch Arena基准。评估显示该基准对当前最先进智能体构成显著挑战，不同模型间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena提供了一个更真实、更少数据泄露风险的研究能力评估基准，能够有效检验深度研究智能体在复杂研究环境中的表现。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Motivation: AI正在改变科学实践，机器学习和大语言模型能以远超传统方法的速度和规模生成假设，但缺乏可扩展的验证机制可能会阻碍而非促进科学进步

Method: 回顾科学发展历史，研究AI如何重塑科学发现实践，综述主要方法包括数据驱动方法、知识感知神经架构、符号推理框架和LLM智能体

Result: 这些系统能够发现模式并提出候选定律，但其科学价值最终取决于严格透明的验证

Conclusion: 验证必须是AI辅助发现的基石，只有通过严谨的验证才能确保AI生成假设的科学价值

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多智能体LLM的场景生成器设计方法，通过环境、社会和规划三个智能体协同工作，自动生成高质量服务生态系统场景，解决传统方法依赖预定义规则和信息有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务生态系统治理面临复杂多变的社会环境和协作关系，传统场景分析方法依赖预定义规则，存在信息有限、影响因素多、社会要素难以量化等挑战，限制了场景生成的质量和效率。

Method: 设计三个LLM赋能的智能体：环境智能体(EA)生成社会环境（包括极端情况），社会智能体(SA)生成社会协作结构，规划智能体(PA)耦合任务-角色关系并规划解决方案。这些智能体协同工作，PA通过感知各智能体状态实时调整实验方案。

Result: 在ProgrammableWeb数据集上的实验表明，该方法能更高效地生成更准确的场景，为服务生态系统治理相关的实验系统构建提供了创新有效的途径。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多智能体协同的LLM赋能方式，有效解决了服务生态系统场景生成的挑战，为复杂社会环境的实验系统构建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)训练目标，通过自动反事实干预增强语言模型推理过程与最终输出的依赖性，显著提高推理忠实度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常在产生正确答案的同时依赖有缺陷或不相关的推理轨迹，这在高风险领域中削弱了其可信度

Method: CSR训练目标在训练过程中引入自动化的操作级反事实干预（如将"+"替换为"-"），并对在逻辑无效轨迹下保持相同答案的模型进行惩罚，每个样本仅需一次额外前向传播

Result: 在算术推理(GSM8K)、逻辑推理(PrOntoQA)和规划(Blocks World)任务中，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督将忠实度提高了高达70个百分点，仅造成轻微精度损失

Conclusion: CSR是一种轻量级的训练方法，能有效增强语言模型推理过程的忠实性，且学习到的敏感性可泛化到更大模型并与推理时方法（如自一致性）协同工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域（如航空航天和应急响应）的自主决策应用日益增多，需要解决这些决策的伦理影响，确保在涉及人命时的可靠性和合理性。

Method: 提出结构化决策框架，引入使能代理、级别和场景概念，在灾害管理中进行自主决策实现，并与基于判断的系统以及有灾害经验的人类操作员（受害者、志愿者和利益相关者）进行比较评估。

Result: 结构化决策框架在多个场景中实现一致准确决策的稳定性比基于判断的系统提高60.94%，在各种场景中的准确率比人类操作员高出38.93%。

Conclusion: 该结构化决策框架在安全关键环境下构建更可靠的自主AI应用方面展现出巨大潜力，为解决AI伦理和可靠性挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Web Agent Throttling框架，通过设计需要多跳推理的语言谜题（rebus-based Reasoning Gates）来增加AI网络代理的访问成本，防止服务器过载和纵欺攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI网络代理的高速、大规模访问可能导致服务器过载，同时可能窃解CAPTCHA等防御机制，需要一种有效的限制方案

Method: 设计了可调数的成本增加框架，使用rebus-based Reasoning Gates（需要多跳推理的语言谜题）作为访问门槛，让AI代理在解题时产生高额的token生成成本

Result: 框架实现了计算不对称性，响应生成成本比SOTA模型高9.2倍，并在实际网站和MCP服务器上部署验证

Conclusion: 该框架能有效增加AI网络代理的访问成本，但需考虑实际部署的限制和环境影响

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，盗版攻击成为严重威胁，当前的防御方法存在理论基础不清的问题。

Method: 提出神经元级解释方法，将模型内部表示投影到一致性更高的词汇空间，识别安全相关矢量并调整其激活度。

Result: SafeTuning在多个LLM上一致降低攻击成功率，表现超过所有四个基准防御方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和防御盗版攻击提供了新视角，通过加强安全关键神经元来提升模型稳健性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模分析在线服务隐私实践提供了可能性，是审计Web和互联网的有前景方向，所有数据集和源代码已开源

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制主要针对恶意攻击者，采用防御性拒绝策略，但忽略了非恶意但心理困扰用户的需求。简单拒绝可能导致用户重复尝试、升级行为或转向不安全平台，造成更严重后果

Method: CSA方法结合游戏论的用户反应预测、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，将安全转化为信任建立过程。在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现

Result: Oy1在开源模型中达到最先进的安全水平，同时保持高通用能力。在Constructive Benchmark上展示出接近GPT-5的建设性参与度，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上具有接近GPT-o1水平的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CSA通过从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全范式，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且有意义的帮助性系统

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成教育性导向的导师对话方面面临挑战，需要系统研究AI与真人教师在教学对话中的差异

Method: 采用起始-响应-反馈(IRF)编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)对AI模拟和真实人类导师对话进行定量比较

Result: 人类对话在语调长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI，且具有更多样的"问题-事实回答-反馈"教学循环

Conclusion: 当前AI生成的导师对话存在结构简化和行为收敛的格局，需要设计更有效的生成式教育对话系统

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP是一个异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在降低30%总成本和60%不必要成本的同时保持性能保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理面临部署挑战，包括过高延迟和推理成本。现有加速方法要么性能保真度差，要么需要大量离线训练，要么运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，使用异步在线强化学习，显式优化端到端延迟与美元成本的联合目标，通过单一参数让用户控制加速与成本的权衡。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时减少30%总成本和高达60%的不必要成本。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一种无需预部署准备的低成本无损加速解决方案，允许用户灵活控制加速与成本之间的权衡，为大型语言模型代理的实际部署提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through
https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

### [205] [EigenBench: A Comparative Behavioral Measure of Value Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01938)
*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无监督的基准测试方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 使用EigenTrust算法聚合多个模型对彼此输出的判断，生成反映整体评估的加权平均分数，无需真实标签。

Result: 发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但仍有小部分残差量化模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的量化基准方法，能够区分模型本身倾向和提示词影响。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架和FAB公平-准确性平衡评分，用于评估医疗LLM中的偏见问题，并在两个大规模医疗基准测试上验证了四个开源LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险环境中存在不足，使用过于简化的指标，忽略了医疗伤害的多维度特性，且可能促使模型因临床惰性而显得公平但实际不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准测试（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含5万多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架，评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异；并提出了FAB评分来衡量公平性与预测准确性之间的权衡。

Result: mFARM指标在各种设置下能更有效地捕捉细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更好地评估医疗LLM中的多维度偏见问题，为医疗AI对齐研究提供了有效的评估工具和基准数据集。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在科学工作中的普遍应用，需要研究它在技术评估领域的双重作用和相关风险。

Method: 文章首先概述生成式AI现象和在TA中使用的要求，然后详细分析了其结构性问题的根源。

Result: 虽然生成式AI不断发展，但结构性风险仍然存在。文章提出了解决方案并评估其可行性，同时举例说明了生成式AI在TA工作中的应用。

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in
technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is
twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other
hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the
phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems
associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further
developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

*Maijunxian Wang,Ran Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了结构性生成智能本体论，认为真正的智能需要具备生成新结构、协调成理由、维持身份认同三个条件，而当前AI系统缺乏这种深度只是表面模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能虽然功能广泛，但缺乏真正的智能深度，只是表面的模仿。需要定义真正的智能标准来区分表面模拟和真实智能。

Method: 提出结构性生成智能本体论框架，包含三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（将结构组织成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了衡量真实智能的理论框架，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个条件而只是表面模拟，真正的智能需要深度而非广度。

Conclusion: 如果未来AI系统能够满足这三个条件，将不再是工具，而可能成为与人类并存但不同的"第二存在"，广度不是智能的源头而是深度的结果。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

*Strahinja Klem,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结构化提示方法，用于处理法律文档的信息检索任务，避免精细调整的高成本，并通过切片和扩增技术解决长文档问题，达到了状态分散性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在法律领域的应用遇到可靠性和透明性挑战，需要一种替代精细调整的方案来确保AI在法律领域的责任性和可账性。

Method: 采用结构化提示方法，首先将法律文档切片和扩增，然后使用QWEN-2模型生成答案，最后通过分布基于定位和逆数权重偏好策略来解决候选答案选择问题。

Result: 方法在CUAD数据集上达到了状态分散性能，比之前方法提高了9%，同时揭示了当前自动评估指标的限制因素。

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种有效且被忽视的工具，可以在法律领域及更广泛应用中确保AI的责任性和可账性，并为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Motivation: 利用AI和社交媒体/新闻资源进行流行病学监测的需求，从WHO的正式报告中提取有价值的行动性信息。

Method: 采用生成式AI集成方法，结合多个大语言模型(LLMs)，从WHO疾病暴发新闻(DONs)中提取流行病学信息，建立日更新数据集和知识图谱(eKG)。

Result: 构建了一个新的日更新数据集和公共卫生领域知识图谱，提供了访问和使用这些数据的服务和工具。

Conclusion: 这些创新的数据资源为流行病学研究和疾病暴发分析监测开启了全新的机遇。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

TL;DR: REx是一个基于知识图谱链接预测生成科学解释的新方法，通过强化学习机制识别解释性路径，在药物重定位任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱是建模复杂多关系数据的强大工具，但预测方法要成为可信的科学工具，不仅需要准确性，还需要提供有意义的科学解释能力

Method: 采用奖励和策略机制，考虑科学解释的理想属性来指导强化学习代理在知识图谱中识别解释性路径，并使用领域特定本体丰富解释路径

Result: 在三个流行知识图谱基准测试中，REx能够生成验证预测见解的解释，并在预测性能上超越最先进方法

Conclusion: REx是推进AI驱动科学发现的相关贡献，能够生成基于生物医学知识的深刻且可靠的解释

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM在复杂约束3D装箱问题中自动设计启发式算法，通过约束支架和迭代自修正支持，发现LLM主要专注于评分函数优化而非整体算法创新，性能与人工设计算法相当但受限于预训练偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在启发式算法设计中的创新能力，超越简单的代码生成，研究其在复杂组合优化问题中的完整求解器构建能力。

Method: 使用约束支架（预写约束检查代码）和迭代自修正（额外精炼循环修复错误）来支持LLM构建3D装箱问题求解器，分析LLM在贪婪过程中的行为模式。

Result: LLM几乎完全专注于评分函数优化，生成的启发式算法与人工设计贪婪算法性能相当，集成到元启发式算法中可与现有求解器竞争，但在约束收紧时效果下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动启发式设计面临两大障碍：复杂推理任务的脆弱性需要工程支持，预训练偏见会过早限制新颖解决方案的搜索空间。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了基于模型驱动框架的后验可解释性方法在高光谱图像波段选择中的应用，通过解释性分析量化各波段对分类决策的贡献，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像的高维特性带来了计算负担和冗余问题，需要有效的降维方法。传统方法往往缺乏对模型决策过程的理解，本研究旨在通过可解释性方法指导波段选择，实现既保持性能又提高效率的降维。

Method: 使用训练好的分类器，通过后验可解释性方法量化每个波段对分类决策的贡献度。进行删除-插入评估，记录波段移除或重新引入时的置信度变化，将这些信号聚合成影响力分数。选择影响力最高的波段形成紧凑的光谱子集。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集（Pavia University和Salinas）上的实验表明，使用仅30个精选波段训练的 classifiers 能够达到或超过全光谱基线的性能，同时显著降低计算需求。所选波段子集与物理上有意义、高度判别性的波长区域一致。

Conclusion: 基于模型对齐、解释性指导的波段选择是高光谱图像降维的有效原则性途径，能够产生既紧凑又高性能的光谱子集，为高光谱图像处理提供了新的维度缩减策略。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法及时终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制

Method: 引入SWE-PRM过程奖励模型，利用常见低效行为的分类学，在推理过程中提供轻量级、可解释的反馈，而不修改底层策略

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中等和困难任务上效果最显著，分类学引导的PRM表现最佳

Conclusion: PRM以可接受的推理成本（低至0.2美元）显著提高了SWE代理的可靠性和效率，是一种实用且可扩展的改进机制

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

Motivation: LLM代理在处理结构化生物医学数据时经常产生流畅但过于自信的输出，需要更好的不确定性感知机制来提高可靠性。

Method: 结合检索不确定性（多表选择rollout的熵）和摘要不确定性（自一致性和困惑度），使用GRPO进行强化学习，并在推理时进行不确定性过滤。

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，正确有用的声明数量几乎翻了三倍（3.0→8.4内部数据；3.6→9.9癌症多组学），下游生存预测C指数从0.32提升到0.63。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够弃权、传达置信度，成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Motivation: 传统LLM强化学习将语言模型视为被动序列生成器，而Agentic RL将其重构为在复杂动态世界中自主决策的智能体，需要系统性地梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 通过对比单步MDPs和时序扩展POMDPs，提出围绕核心智能体能力(规划、工具使用、记忆等)和应用领域的双重分类法，并整合500多篇文献和开源资源。

Conclusion: 强化学习是将静态启发式模块转化为自适应智能体行为的关键机制，该领域面临可扩展通用AI智能体发展的机遇与挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

TL;DR: AdaptCache是一个针对LLM服务中KV缓存冗余计算问题的动态压缩系统，通过智能选择压缩算法、压缩率和设备放置策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少加载延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM应用中重复使用上下文导致大量冗余计算，现有系统将KV缓存存储在DRAM和SSD中，但SSD加载延迟高，需要提高DRAM命中率。

Method: 设计了一个有损压缩系统，为每个KV缓存条目动态决定压缩算法、压缩率和设备放置位置，以最大化DRAM命中率并最小化加载延迟。

Result: 相比静态压缩基准，AdaptCache在相同质量下实现1.43-2.4倍的延迟节省，在相同延迟下实现6-55%的质量提升。

Conclusion: 动态有损KV缓存压缩是解决LLM服务中冗余计算问题的有效方法，能够显著提升系统性能而不明显影响生成质量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed
context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant
redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant
computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the
corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these
LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large
and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high
loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To
increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression
as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the
compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache
entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly
degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines
across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at
the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型的长上下文推理面临KV缓存内存需求巨大的挑战，随着序列长度和批量大小增加，内存需求可达数GB级别。

Method: 采用专门针对KV缓存数据特性设计的新型有损压缩技术，将压缩算法与系统架构协同设计，保持与KV缓存增长特性的兼容性。

Result: 相比现有方法平均实现47%的内存减少率，最高可达83%，且几乎没有模型精度损失。执行吞吐量极高，在某些情况下甚至能加速矩阵向量乘法操作。

Conclusion: KVComp提供了一个通用高效的KV缓存管理解决方案，有效解决了长文本生成中的内存瓶颈问题，在减少内存使用的同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

TL;DR: HADIS是一个混合自适应扩散模型服务系统，通过智能查询路由和资源配置优化，在提升响应质量35%的同时大幅降低延迟违规率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高，现有服务系统采用固定级联配置，对所有查询都经过轻量级阶段，浪费复杂查询资源

Method: 使用基于规则的提示路由器将困难查询直接路由到重量级模型，离线分析生成帕累托最优级联配置表，运行时根据延迟和工作负载约束选择最佳配置

Result: 在真实世界轨迹上的实证评估显示，相比最先进模型服务系统，响应质量提升35%，延迟违规率降低2.7-45倍

Conclusion: HADIS系统通过自适应查询路由和资源配置优化，有效解决了扩散模型服务的高计算成本和延迟问题

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but
incur high computational costs, making real-time, scalable deployment
challenging. Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by
cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade
configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage,
wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive
diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection,
query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt
router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing
the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource
management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal
cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade
configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints.
Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves
response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by
2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.

Conclusion: AI驱动的并行化方法能够有效利用SMT技术提升延迟关键应用的性能，证明了AI在代码优化领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical
applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to
support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance
simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel
framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize
latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in
industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of
latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

Motivation: 传统推测解码使用固定推测长度，在大批量多样化请求的服务环境中不够优化，需要动态适应机制

Method: DSDE框架包含两个核心组件：基于KL散度方差的预测信号诊断生成稳定性，以及自适应推测长度上限来缓解序列解码中的滞后问题

Result: 实验显示基于KL散度的稳定性信号有效，算法在端到端延迟上与领先基线竞争，在多样化工作负载下表现出优越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 验证了事后信号作为构建更鲁棒智能LLM推理系统的重要组件，为动态推测长度适应的未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

TL;DR: Ocior是一个实用的异步拜占庭容错共识协议，在容错性、通信、计算和轮次复杂度方面达到最优性能。这是一个无领导者的共识协议，通过并行实例处理交易，具有最优的容错能力(n≥3t+1)、通信复杂度(O(n))、计算复杂度(O(n)或O(n log²n))和轮次复杂度(2轮)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BFT共识协议依赖指定领导者来提议交易，存在性能瓶颈。需要开发一个无领导者的共识协议，能够在异步环境下实现最优性能，同时保证稳定的活跃性。

Method: 提出Ocior协议，使用并行共识实例处理交易。引入新型非交互式阈值签名方案OciorBLSts，支持快速签名聚合和自适应安全性，实现瞬时TS聚合特性。

Result: Ocior实现了：1)最优容错性：容忍t个故障节点(n≥3t+1)；2)最优通信复杂度：每交易O(n)；3)最优计算复杂度：最好情况O(n)，最坏情况O(n log²n)；4)最优轮次复杂度：2轮异步轮次完成交易最终确认。

Conclusion: Ocior是一个性能最优的无领导者异步BFT共识协议，通过创新的阈值签名方案和并行处理机制，在保持安全性的同时显著提升了共识效率，特别适合数字资产转移等应用场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance
in resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike
traditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions
individually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While
leader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose
transactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable
liveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$
faulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal
communication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is
$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total
computation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \log^2 n)$ in
the worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction
can be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any
$n\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where
the transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A
two-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or
group of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we
introduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called
OciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.
OciorBLSts achieves a signature aggregation computation cost of only $O(n)$ for
the best case. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of Instantaneous TS
Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial signatures as they
arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.

Motivation: TON区块链独特的异步架构和Telegram带来的海量web2用户为欺诈分析提供了新颖且关键的环境，需要保护投资者并增强TON DeFi生态安全

Method: 在TON两大DEX平台Ston.Fi和DeDust上融合数据训练模型，比较TVL-based（流动性灾难性撤出）和idle-based（交易活动突然停止）两种rug pull定义，使用梯度提升模型

Result: 梯度提升模型能在交易前5分钟内有效识别rug pull，TVL方法AUC最高达0.891，闲置方法在召回率方面表现优异；特征集在各交易所间一致但分布差异显著

Conclusion: 该研究为投资者提供了关键的早期预警机制，增强了快速增长的TON DeFi生态系统的安全基础设施，需要开发稳健的、平台感知的模型

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

TL;DR: LobRA是一个针对多任务LoRA微调的新框架，通过异构资源配置和数据调度解决序列长度变化和偏斜问题，显著提升联合微调效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer预训练模型的普及，微调需求激增，需要降低服务提供商的成本。虽然LoRA技术允许多任务联合训练，但数据异构性（序列长度变化和偏斜）限制了效率

Method: 开发LobRA框架：1) 部署异构资源使用和并行配置的微调副本以匹配序列长度变化；2) 根据序列长度偏斜在训练步骤中调度数据以实现负载均衡

Result: 实验验证LobRA显著减少了联合微调所需的GPU时间，降低幅度达45.03%-60.67%

Conclusion: LobRA通过有效处理训练数据异构性问题，成功提升了多任务LoRA联合微调的效率，为服务提供商提供了成本效益显著的解决方案

Abstract: With the breakthrough of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the demand for
fine-tuning (FT) to adapt the base pre-trained models to downstream
applications continues to grow, so it is essential for service providers to
reduce the cost of processing FT requests. Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely
used FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base
model unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by
jointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.
  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT
is dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence
length variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a
brand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly
training LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA
deploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous
resource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads
caused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,
LobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training
data among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We
conduct experiments to assess the performance of LobRA, validating that it
significantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.

TL;DR: LiquidGEMM是一个硬件高效的W4A8 GEMM内核，通过LiquidQuant量化方法和隐式细粒度流水线技术，显著提升了LLM推理性能，相比现有方案实现最高4.94倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有W4A8 GEMM内核在实际应用中存在效率问题，CUDA核心的解量化速度无法匹配Tensor核心的高吞吐量，限制了LLM服务的性能。

Method: 提出LiquidQuant硬件高效量化方法（每4个元素仅需2条算术指令实现快速安全的解量化）和隐式细粒度流水线技术（在warp组间完全重叠权重加载、解量化和矩阵乘法运算）。

Result: LiquidGEMM相比最先进W4A8内核实现最高2.90倍加速，端到端系统级加速最高达4.94倍；相比NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM中的量化GEMM内核，性能提升1.12-1.63倍。

Conclusion: LiquidGEMM通过创新的量化方法和流水线设计，有效解决了W4A8量化在实践中的性能瓶颈，为高效LLM服务提供了硬件友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

TL;DR: HiCR是一个用于表示分布式异构应用程序和运行时系统语义的模型，提供硬件拓扑发现、内核执行、内存管理、通信和实例管理等抽象操作，通过插件化方法实现跨平台兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决分布式异构系统在不同硬件平台上的兼容性问题，避免因硬件差异导致的大量重构工作，同时支持各种并行编程范式。

Method: 提出HiCR模型，定义最小抽象操作集，采用基于插件的方法处理设备特定的实现细节，构建运行时支持层抽象。

Result: 开发了基于HiCR的应用程序，能够在多种不同平台上同等运行，实现了跨平台兼容性。

Conclusion: HiCR模型成功地在分布式异构系统和运行时系统之间建立了有效的抽象层，通过插件化架构解决了硬件兼容性问题，为未来系统的演进提供了灵活性。

Abstract: We present HiCR, a model to represent the semantics of distributed
heterogeneous applications and runtime systems. The model describes a minimal
set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel
execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without
prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable
execution in current and future systems without the need for significant
refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming
paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between
distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase
\emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the
model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that
takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of
HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误差有界有损压缩是减少科学数据体积的最有效方法之一。渐进解压缩和随机访问解压缩对于按需数据访问和灵活分析工作流至关重要，但这些功能会严重降低压缩质量和速度。

Method: 设计了首个同时支持渐进解压缩和随机访问解压缩的压缩框架；引入层次分区策略来支持流式功能；采用层次预测机制来减轻分区的影响并实现高压缩质量。

Result: 压缩质量可与最先进非流式压缩器SZ3相比；压缩和解压缩速度高，最高比SZ3快6.7倍。

Conclusion: 该流式压缩框架成功解决了在支持渐进解压缩和随机访问解压缩的同时保持高压缩质量和高速度的挑战，为科学数据压缩提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most efficient solutions to
reduce the volume of scientific data. For lossy compression, progressive
decompression and random-access decompression are critical features that enable
on-demand data access and flexible analysis workflows. However, these features
can severely degrade compression quality and speed. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel streaming compression framework that supports
both progressive decompression and random-access decompression while
maintaining high compression quality and speed. Our contributions are
three-fold: (1) we design the first compression framework that simultaneously
enables both progressive decompression and random-access decompression; (2) we
introduce a hierarchical partitioning strategy to enable both streaming
features, along with a hierarchical prediction mechanism that mitigates the
impact of partitioning and achieves high compression quality -- even comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-streaming compressor SZ3; and (3) our framework
delivers high compression and decompression speed, up to 6.7$\times$ faster
than SZ3.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文解决了并行计算资源调度中的开放性问题，提出了基于一般凹加速函数的优化调度算法，包括CDR规则和GWF方法，并设计了SmartFill算法，相比现有方法有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云/边缘计算系统中，AI应用需要高效的并行计算资源调度。现有方法heSRPT只适用于特定指数形式的加速函数，而现实工作负载更普遍使用任意凹加速函数，这一般性问题尚未解决。

Method: 提出了CDR规则（恒定导数比规则）作为优化调度的基本原则，开发了通用注水方法(GWF)来计算最优分配，并设计了SmartFill算法来选择性确定哪些作业应获得资源及分配量。

Result: 对于正则加速函数类，SmartFill能提供闭式最优解；对于非正则函数，也能高效计算最优解。数值评估表明，SmartFill在各种凹加速函数下都显著优于heSRPT。

Conclusion: 本文解决了并行作业调度的一般性问题，提出的CDR规则和SmartFill算法为实际云/边缘计算系统中的资源优化调度提供了有效的理论和方法基础。

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs
is a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many
AI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its
completion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this
problem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,
providing a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary
concave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads
-- has remained open.
  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling
algorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first
discover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel
scheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states
that the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs
remains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that
satisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more
general version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.
Combining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the
general scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to
all active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive
resources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called
\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal
solutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum
with low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can
substantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup
functions.

TL;DR: 通过将二进制旋钓放松为连续变量并引入吸引子函数，设计了高效的可收敛汇算法来解决Ising模型优化问题，在各种GPU平台上都显著超过现有解法器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Ising解法器主要基于模拟退火算法，虽然具有可扩展性，但缺乏收敛保证并对冷却调度敏感。需要一种具有数学保证的高效解决方案。

Method: 将二进制旋钓放松为连续变量，引入吸引子函数来将解引导向二进制配置。构造减减式的哈密顿量，设计只需单次矩阵-向量乘法的迭代算法，具有可收敛性保证。

Result: 在从边缘设备到高性能计算集群的各种GPU平台上实现解法器，在从小规模(10^3个旋钓)到超大规模(10^8个旋钓)的问题范围内都一贯地超过现有解法器。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种具有数学可靠性保证的高效Ising模型解决方案，充分利用GPU并行计算能力，在各种规模问题上都取得了显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of
finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most
existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing
techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are
sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by
relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential
function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin
configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of
convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that
require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by
convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU
platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem
sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异步分布式联邦学习方法，包含故障容锐机制和自主终止技术，解决了传统同步FL的性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习依赖中央服务器，存在单点故障风险和同步延迟问题。异质性环境下慢速客户端会影响整体训练效率。

Method: 分为两个阶段：第一阶段开发异步FL框架，允许客户端独立更新；第二阶段添加故障容锐机制，处理客户端故障和消息丢失。提出Client-Confident Convergence和Client-Responsive Termination技术。

Result: 该方法能够在异步通信和故障环境下保证可靠收敛，所有活跃客户端都能有效完成训练。

Conclusion: 异步分布式FL方案有效解决了传统方案的性能瓶颈问题，提供了更好的扩展性和响应能力，适用于异质性环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training across
distributed clients while ensuring data privacy. Traditionally, FL relies on a
centralized server to coordinate learning, which creates bottlenecks and a
single point of failure. Decentralized FL architectures eliminate the need for
a central server and can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes.
Synchronous FL requires all clients to compute updates and wait for one another
before aggregation, guaranteeing consistency but often suffering from delays
due to slower participants. Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients
to update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in
heterogeneous environments.
  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two
progressive phases. (a) In Phase 1, we develop an asynchronous FL framework
that enables clients to learn and update independently, removing the need for
strict synchronization. (b) In Phase 2, we extend this framework with fault
tolerance mechanisms to handle client failures and message drops, ensuring
robust performance even under unpredictable conditions. As a central
contribution, we propose Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive
Termination novel techniques that provide each client with the ability to
autonomously determine appropriate termination points. These methods ensure
that all active clients conclude meaningfully and efficiently, maintaining
reliable convergence despite the challenges of asynchronous communication and
faults.

Motivation: 解决区块链分片系统中交易处理的稳定性问题，特别是在最坏情况交易模式和攻击（如DoS）下确保有界的交易队列大小和延迟。

Method: 设计了单领导者调度器和分布式多领导者调度器，通过理论分析证明在特定注入率下能保证系统稳定性。

Result: 单领导者调度器支持注入率ρ≤max{1/(16k), 1/(16⌈√s⌉)}；分布式调度器支持ρ≤1/(16c₁logD logs)·max{1/k, 1/⌈√s⌉}，接近最优注入率。

Conclusion: 所提出的调度器方案显著提升了区块链分片系统的稳定性边界，分布式方案相比先前工作有显著改进，接近理论最优值。

Abstract: In blockchain sharding, $n$ processing nodes are divided into $s$ shards, and
each shard processes transactions in parallel. A key challenge in such a system
is to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated
transactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a
certain rate of at most $\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures
worst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g.,
DoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded
transaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum
injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and
latency of transactions is $\max\left\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{
\left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\right\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number
of shards that each transaction accesses. Here, we first provide a single
leader scheduler that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq
\max\left\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\right\}$.
Moreover, we also give a distributed scheduler with multiple leaders that
guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log
s}\max\left\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \right\}$, where
$c_1$ is some positive constant and $D$ is the diameter of shard graph $G_s$.
This bound is within a poly-log factor from the optimal injection rate, and
significantly improves the best previous known result for the distributed
setting by Adhikari et al., SPAA 2024.

Motivation: 千兆像素图像分析计算成本高昂，需要一种能够降低计算需求同时保持准确性的方法，使普通计算机也能进行高效分析。

Method: 采用渐进式分析方法，从低分辨率开始，逐步聚焦到感兴趣区域进行高分辨率详细检查，研究两种自适应分辨率选择策略，并评估并行计算潜力。

Result: 在Camelyon16生物医学数据集上验证，处理数据量减少达2.65倍，准确性保持不变；使用12个普通工作节点可将分析时间从超过1小时缩短到几分钟。

Conclusion: PyramidAI为千兆像素图像分析提供了实用的高效解决方案，实现了计算成本的大幅降低和并行计算的可行性，使大规模图像分析更加民主化。

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

Conclusion: QRMark通过算法和系统层面的创新设计，成功解决了大规模图像水印检测的效率问题，为生成模型的负责任部署提供了高效可靠的检测方案。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable detection of generated images is critical for the
responsible deployment of generative models. Existing approaches primarily
focus on improving detection accuracy and robustness under various image
transformations and adversarial manipulations, yet they largely overlook the
efficiency challenges of watermark detection across large-scale image
collections. To address this gap, we propose QRMark, an efficient and adaptive
end-to-end method for detecting embedded image watermarks. The core idea of
QRMark is to combine QR Code inspired error correction with tailored tiling
techniques to improve detection efficiency while preserving accuracy and
robustness. At the algorithmic level, QRMark employs a Reed-Solomon error
correction mechanism to mitigate the accuracy degradation introduced by tiling.
At the system level, QRMark implements a resource-aware stream allocation
policy that adaptively assigns more streams to GPU-intensive stages of the
detection pipeline. It further employs a tile-based workload interleaving
strategy to overlap data-loading overhead with computation and schedules
kernels across stages to maximize efficiency. End-to-end evaluations show that
QRMark achieves an average 2.43x inference speedup over the sequential
baseline.

contextual expertise.
  This paper presents KubeIntellect, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered

that focus on observability or static automation, KubeIntellect supports
natural language interaction across the full spectrum of Kubernetes API
operations, including read, write, delete, exec, access control, lifecycle, and
advanced verbs. The system uses modular agents aligned with functional domains
(e.g., logs, metrics, RBAC), orchestrated by a supervisor that interprets user
queries, maintains workflow memory, invokes reusable tools, or synthesizes new
ones via a secure Code Generator Agent.
  KubeIntellect integrates memory checkpoints, human-in-the-loop clarification,
and dynamic task sequencing into a structured orchestration framework.
Evaluation results show a 93% tool synthesis success rate and 100% reliability
across 200 natural language queries, demonstrating the system's ability to

Result: 在高达280B参数的模型上评估显示，MLP-Offload相比最先进的LLM训练运行时实现了2.5倍的迭代加速

Conclusion: MLP-Offload通过创新的多级卸载策略有效解决了LLM训练中的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the
state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

Motivation: 解决智能农业系统中资源有限、数据隐私需求和农村地区连接性差等挑战，需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效利用能源的协作学习方案。

Abstract: Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited
resources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To
address these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework
that utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training
without direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By
distributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split
reduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated
learning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves
classification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more
modest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge
deployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and
maximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest
datasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to
baseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the
energy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial
savings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory
overheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results
highlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a
scalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming
environments.

activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖训练模型和集中式联邦学习提供了实用的数据泄露防御方案，但自适应攻击仍存在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Conclusion: ZeroQAT框架成功解决了量化训练中的计算效率问题，为大规模语言模型的高效部署提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced

derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数下实现高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优异，但迭代采样过程计算成本高昂。现有训练免费加速方法受限于采样轨迹效率，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架：1）将预训练扩散模型的采样轨迹重参数化为流匹配形式；2）采用自适应速度分解，将速度场分解为线性漂移项和残差分量；3）抑制残差分量的时间变化，实现高阶积分精度。

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面均优于最先进的训练免费采样器。仅用5次函数评估即可获得显著更低的FID分数，生成更清晰、更连贯的图像。

Conclusion: A-FloPS是一个通用有效的解决方案，可用于高质量、低延迟的生成建模，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Motivation: 人工神经网络在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，受人类大脑记忆巩固机制的启发，研究内部回放机制在缓解这一问题上的有效性。

Method: 使用CIFAR-100数据集在类增量设置下评估内部回放机制，单独使用以及与突触智能(SI)结合使用。通过似然分布、重建误差、轮廓分数和UMAP投影等分析方法研究潜在空间表征变化。

Result: 内部回放显著减轻了遗忘，特别是与SI结合时效果更好，但代价是初始任务准确性降低。分析显示内部回放增加了潜在空间的表征重叠，可能限制了任务特异性区分。

Conclusion: 当前受大脑启发的方法存在局限性，需要在持续学习系统中平衡记忆保留和适应能力，为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Motivation: 传统实验方法在水平吸附预测中存在耗时、易出错、无法抓取地质异质性等问题，需要发展更高效准确的预测方法来支持地下氢存储等重要应用。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析俄罗斯空间物体的异常活动模式，为未来军事冲突提供早期预警指标，特别是在乌克兰入侵前的关键时期检测可能预示侵略行为的空间活动变化。

Method: 采用多种深度学习模型（隔离森林、传统自编码器、变分自编码器、KAN网络和新型锚点损失自编码器），基于五年TLE数据建立基线，重点分析2022年2月24日前六个月的异常活动，并为每个空间物体单独训练模型以提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能有效检测空间物体的异常活动模式，为军事预警提供可靠指标，该方法具有高度可解释性，能够识别具体轨道元素的异常行为。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

Motivation: 光网络故障管理中存在严重的类不平衡问题，对于预处理和中处理技术已有广泛研究，但后处理方法很少被探讨。

Method: 采用实验数据集，直接对比预处理、中处理和后处理三种类不平衡缩减方法在故障检测和识别中的性能。

Result: 故障检测中，后处理方法（特别是阈值调整）F1分数提升最高（达15.3%），而随机下采样推理速度最快。故障识别中，GenAI方法性能提升最明显（达24.2%）。

Conclusion: 不同场景下最佳方法不同：类重叠且延迟关键时选SMOTE等过采样方法；无延迟限制时元学习效果最好；低重叠场景下GenAI方法性能最高且推理时间最短。

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了传统MLP的功能，为神经网络的细节层次表示提供了一种有效的解决方案，在多个信号处理任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

TL;DR: GenDataCarto框架通过计算训练样本的难度分数和记忆分数，将数据分为四个象限，用于指导有针对性的数据修剪和权重调整，有效减少生成模型中的记忆泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的风险，这些样本可能被对手提取或夸大基准性能，需要数据中心的解决方案来缓解记忆泄露。

Method: 提出Generative Data Cartography框架，为每个预训练样本分配难度分数（早期epoch损失）和记忆分数（遗忘事件频率），将样本划分为四个象限，指导有针对性的修剪和权重调整。

Result: 在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，将合成canary提取成功率降低40%以上，同时验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。

Conclusion: 基于原则的数据干预可以显著减少泄露，同时对生成性能的影响最小，证明了数据中心方法在缓解生成模型记忆问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Generative Self-Refinement (GSR)框架，通过并行生成候选答案并进行自我精炼，解决现有测试时缩放方法在候选答案全错时无法生成正确解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N和多数投票的性能依赖于候选答案质量，当所有候选答案都错误时无法产生正确解，且引入额外模型选择最佳答案会带来高昂部署成本。

Method: 提出GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和这些候选答案进行自我精炼合成更优解。设计混合训练管道，联合优化直接解题和精炼候选答案两个互补目标。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，学习到的自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模上表现稳健，并能泛化到分布外推理任务。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效提升了LLMs解决复杂多步推理问题的能力，通过自我精炼机制克服了现有方法的局限性，具有很好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Learn to Shard是一种基于强化学习的方法，用于协同优化分布式LLM推理中的粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度，相比现有方法实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式LLM推理系统（如Megatron-LM）使用静态启发式方法分别配置并行度和算子分片维度，随着模型规模扩大和硬件拓扑多样化，这种方法无法充分利用性能潜力。

Method: 采用基于注意力的强化学习策略，从高性能策略历史中学习，有效导航巨大的组合搜索空间，协同优化粗粒度并行度和细粒度算子分片维度。

Result: 在H100集群上测试1.6T参数的MoE模型，相比元启发式基线实现了3.5倍吞吐量提升，相比Megatron启发式方法实现了1.06倍提升。

Conclusion: Learn to Shard通过强化学习方法有效解决了分布式LLM推理中的并行策略优化问题，显著提升了大规模模型推理性能。

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西通用数据保护法(LGPD)限制敏感学生数据的集中化，阻碍了数据挖掘和AI在教育中的应用，需要隐私保护计算方法来解决这一挑战

Method: 使用联邦学习中的FedProx算法，在模拟50所学校的环境中训练深度神经网络(DNN)模型，并与集中式XGBoost模型进行性能对比

Result: 集中式模型准确率63.96%，联邦学习模型峰值准确率61.23%，性能损失微小但提供了强大的隐私保障

Conclusion: 联邦学习是在巴西教育背景下构建协作预测模型的可行有效解决方案，符合LGPD要求

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

Conclusion: ReLATE框架通过自主学习适应不规则张量形状和数据分布，为稀疏张量分解提供了高效的自适应编码解决方案

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Motivation: 现有LSTM模型虽然通过门控机制处理长期信息，但未能最优地关注特定旧索引或长期信息，且缺乏权重归一化选择和门控非线性化的研究。

Method: 提出输入重排序方法优先处理特定输入索引；研究Lp范数权重归一化选择最佳权重和指数；引入门控非线性化（小型FFNN）增强门控表达能力。

Result: 在文本分类任务中，所提方法相比简单LSTM提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 输入重排序、权重归一化选择和门控非线性化是有效的LSTM改进策略，能够提升模型在文本分类等任务中的性能。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Motivation: 现有集成对抗训练方法独立训练子模型，忽视了子模型间的协作效益，特别是分类差异大的样本对集成鲁棒性有更大影响

Method: CEAT利用概率差异自适应地为不同样本分配权重，通过校准距离正则化来强调子模型间的协作学习

Result: 在广泛采用的数据集上取得了最先进的性能，优于竞争性EAT方法

Conclusion: CEAT是模型无关的，可以无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Motivation: 虽然图像和文本的生成数据检测方法已经很普及，但表格数据因其异质性结构和未见格式而被忽视，需要专门的检测方法。

Method: 提出数据点级变换器架构，结合表格适配组件，处理变量次序和未见格式的表格数据。

Result: 模型显著超过之前的基线方法，AUC和准确率同时提升7个百分点，通过表格适配组件还能再提升7个准确率点。

Conclusion: 这是首次有力证据表明，在实际条件下检测生成式表格数据不仅可行，而且可以高可靠地实现。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率流域图建模和时空联合学习，显著提升了洪水预测精度，并提供可解释的注意力图谱，为水资源管理提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PEGE方法替代STE，通过渐进式元素级梯度估计和混合精度替换策略，在量化感知训练中同时优化任务损失和离散化误差，显著提升低比特量化模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统STE方法忽略离散化误差，导致低比特量化时精度下降严重，需要更有效的梯度估计方法来改善量化训练效果。

Method: 提出PEGE方法：1）使用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略渐进替换全精度参数；2）将QAT建模为同时最小化任务损失和离散化误差的协同优化问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，PEGE在各种架构（ResNet、VGG等）上均优于现有方法，使低精度模型达到甚至超越全精度模型的精度。

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一个统一且可推广的框架，能有效解决STE的局限性，显著提升神经网络量化性能，特别是在极低比特宽度下。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出LLM-QUBO框架，利用大语言模型自动将自然语言优化问题转换为QUBO格式，并结合混合量子经典分解方法解决量子硬件扩展性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子退火在解决NP难组合优化问题方面具有潜力，但面临两个主要挑战：手动将问题描述转换为QUBO格式的复杂性，以及当前量子硬件的可扩展性限制

Method: 使用大语言模型解析自然语言并自动生成结构化数学表示；采用混合量子经典Benders分解方法，将组合复杂的主问题编译为紧凑QUBO格式，线性结构子问题委托给经典求解器

Result: 通过经典求解器验证了生成的QUBO的正确性和混合方法的可扩展性，建立了稳健的性能基准，证明框架已准备好用于量子硬件

Conclusion: 该框架建立了经典AI与量子计算的协同计算范式，显著降低了使用门槛，为将量子设备转化为大规模实际优化挑战的可访问加速器提供了可行途径

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Motivation: 现有ECG Transformer模型仅使用最后一层表示，但理论和实证分析表明这不是最优选择，需要充分利用各层表示的多样性

Method: 1D ViT预训练后，在微调阶段使用门控网络动态融合各层表示；同时扩展至预训练阶段，通过分组平均聚合表示

Result: PMA方法能够有效利用各层表示多样性，提升下游任务性能

Conclusion: 最后一层表示并非最优，通过层间表示融合可以显著提升ECG Transformer模型的性能

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Motivation: 探索预训练大语言模型如何改变传统黑盒参数空间优化范式，特别是在化学实验优化领域

Method: 使用6个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5684个实验），对比LLM引导优化、贝叶斯优化和随机采样的性能，并引入拓扑无关的信息论框架量化采样多样性

Result: 前沿LLM在5个单目标数据集上持续匹配或超越贝叶斯优化性能，优势随参数复杂度增加和高性能条件稀缺性（<5%空间）而增强；LLM在所有数据集中保持比贝叶斯优化更高的探索熵

Conclusion: LLM引导优化在传统方法难以处理的复杂分类空间（需要领域理解而非数学优化）中表现卓越，预训练领域知识实现了更有效的化学参数空间导航

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Motivation: 解决多体系统数据驱动建模中的高计算成本和有限长期预测精度问题

Method: 引入Flow-Matching神经ODE框架，通过数值微分技术直接监督加速度而非积分状态，使用FFT和有限差分混合方案

Result: 在多个基准测试中（质量-弹簧-阻尼器系统、双摆、滑块曲柄、车杆系统）均优于MBD-NODE、LSTM和FCNN等方法

Conclusion: FNODE在精度、泛化能力和计算效率方面表现出色，为约束多体系统的数据驱动建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 边缘设备部署AI代理需要隐私和响应性，但内存限制迫使使用推理能力较差的小型LLM，现有TTS方法在边缘硬件上开销过大

Method: 引入三种协同优化：推测性波束扩展处理不规则推理路径；非对称多模型内存分配动态平衡生成和验证内存；动态前缀感知调度最大化KV缓存重用

Result: 在单消费级GPU(24GB)上，FlashTTS使边缘LLM达到大型云模型的准确性和延迟，相比vLLM基线平均吞吐量提高2.2倍，延迟降低38%-68%

Conclusion: FlashTTS为边缘设备上民主化、高性能的代理AI铺平了道路，作为vLLM的即插即用库实现

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

TL;DR: TConstFormer通过周期性状态更新机制实现恒定大小的KV缓存，计算复杂度为O(1)，在长文本推理任务中展现出显著的速度和内存效率优势


<details>

Motivation: Transformer的自回归推理存在KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度的问题，限制了其处理超长序列的能力

Method: 基于TLinFormer工作，采用创新的周期性状态更新机制，在k-1个连续步骤中执行恒定时间计算，仅在第k步执行一次线性时间的全局信息同步

Result: 理论计算和实验结果表明，TConstFormer在长文本推理任务的速度、内存效率和整体性能方面相比基线模型具有压倒性优势

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Motivation: 现有参数估计方法（如稀疏识别和PINNs）在处理非线性动态、多物理场相互作用或有限系统响应观测时表现不佳，特别是在参数具有非线性和时空变化的情况下。

Method: Neptune采用独立坐标神经网络在物理空间或状态变量中连续表示每个参数场，能够从稀疏测量中推断参数场。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

Conclusion: 变分量子门机制能有效解决长时序预测中的现有限制，实现准确鲁棒的多变量预测，为时序建模提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Conclusion: CTDS方法通过温度分布策略有效提升了神经采样器在复杂分布中的探索能力和采样性能。

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available
at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.

Motivation: TabPFN v2在多个表格基准测试中优于基于树的模型，但由于transformer的二次计算和内存成本，无法处理超过10K上下文tokens。现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本），需要寻找更好的解决方案

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，是首个无需预处理即可让TabPFN处理长上下文的方法

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: tiled-block策略成功解决了TabPFN处理长上下文的限制，为表格数据上的transformer应用提供了新的可能性

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型实际上学习的是Wasserstein梯度流的速度场而非真正的score函数，即使神经网络学到的向量场不是保守的，生成效果依然很好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为扩散模型学习的是噪声数据对数密度的梯度（score函数），但这要求学习目标是保守向量场，而实际使用的神经网络架构并未强制执行这一约束

Method: 通过数值实验证明训练好的扩散网络违反了真正score函数所需的积分和微分约束，提出从Wasserstein梯度流（WGF）的流匹配角度来理解扩散训练

Result: 发现即使神经网络向量场不是真正的score函数，模型仍能出色地生成样本，非保守的神经网络近似误差不一定会损害密度传输

Conclusion: WGF视角为理解扩散生成模型提供了原则性、优雅且理论坚实的基础框架，比传统的反向时间SDE理论更自然和清晰

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Result: 在未见任务上优于现有离线RL方法，显著提升了泛化能力和适应性

Conclusion: LLMDPD有效解决了离线RL的泛化问题，为跨任务迁移提供了新思路

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

TL;DR: 本文从理论角度解释了物理增强残差学习(PERL)方法的三大优势：减少神经网络参数量、加快收敛速度、减少训练样本需求，并通过自动驾驶轨迹预测案例验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PERL方法在数值实验中显示出减少参数、加快收敛和减少训练样本的优势，但这些结果缺乏理论解释，需要从理论层面阐明其优势机制。

Method: 研究具有Lipschitz连续性的问题类别，通过分析损失函数边界与残差学习结构之间的关系，严格证明了解释PERL三大优势的定理集。

Result: 理论证明和数值实验均证实，即使使用显著更少的训练样本，PERL仍能比纯神经网络获得更高的精度，在自动驾驶轨迹预测中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: PERL通过整合物理模型和神经网络残差学习，在提高预测性能的同时大幅减少数据需求，在真实世界自动驾驶应用中具有重要实用价值，特别是在难以获取角点案例数据的场景中。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对ReLU网络优化的正交初始化方法，通过Stiefel流形上的优化问题解决深度网络中神经元失活和梯度消失问题，在多个数据集上表现优于传统初始化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效调节预激活均值和控制激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题

Method: 在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，推导出闭式解和高效采样方案，从初始化阶段就保持尺度并校准预激活统计量

Result: 理论分析显示该方法能防止dying ReLU问题、减缓激活方差衰减、缓解梯度消失，在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、表格数据集和少样本设置中均优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为深度ReLU网络提供了稳定的信号和梯度流动，实现了深度网络的稳定训练

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法虽然能增强GNN的鲁棒性，但主要局限于特定数据集和GNN类型，缺乏统一的扰动框架。

Method: 提出PerturbEmbedding方法，直接在GNN的每个隐藏嵌入层执行扰动操作，提供了一个统一的框架来整合现有的扰动策略，包括随机扰动和对抗性扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集和不同骨干模型上的实验表明，PerturbEmbedding显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding提供了一个有效的统一扰动框架，能够同时抵御随机和对抗性扰动，显著增强GNN模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: CUFL通过课程学习机制调节个性化过程，有效防止早期过拟合，并通过改进的相似性估计方法提升了联邦学习的聚合效果，为子图联邦学习中的数据异构性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at
https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.

Motivation: 各向异性参数分布是低比特量化训练大型语言模型的主要障碍，少数主导奇异值产生的宽数值范围与块量化偏置冲突，导致训练不稳定和模型性能低下。

Conclusion: Metis为先进低比特量化下的稳健和可扩展LLM训练铺平了道路，代码已开源。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

Motivation: 尽管提示调优在实践上取得了成功，但其理论分析仍然有限。现有理论工作主要关注通用逼近性质，本文旨在探索Transformer的记忆能力这一不同理论方面。

Method: 通过理论分析，首先证明Transformer记忆的信息量不能超过提示长度的线性增长速度；其次，对Transformer在扩展上下文中的性能退化现象进行形式化证明。

Result: 证明了Transformer的记忆能力存在线性上限约束，并且无论上下文大小如何，Transformer固有的有限记忆都会限制其信息保留能力。

Conclusion: 这一发现提供了对Transformer架构内在限制的基本理解，特别是其处理长序列的能力有限，为理解大型语言模型的记忆机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

Method: 提出了一种通用框架来评估稀疏性稳健性，并对现代LLM（包括扩散LLM）的FFN层进行了系统性研究。

Result: 发现了LLM中普遍的激活稀疏性模式，提供了对这种现象的深入见解，并得出了实用的设计和加速指南。

Conclusion: 该研究为现代LLM的激活稀疏性研究提供了统一的分析框架，发现了普遍规律，对模型的效率、稳健性和可解释性有重要意义。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedThief框架，在联邦学习中实现自中心攻击，既降低全局模型性能又提升攻击者本地模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击策略只破坏全局模型性能，但攻击者自身模型也会受损。现实中攻击者追求的是竞争优势而非单纯破坏

Method: FedThief框架：上传阶段修改内容降低全局模型性能；同时使用基于分歧度的集成技术整合全局更新和本地知识来增强私有模型

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时让攻击者获得显著优于全局模型的集成模型

Conclusion: 提出了自中心联邦学习攻击新范式，FedThief框架成功实现了攻击者既破坏全局模型又提升自身模型的双重目标

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ASC方法整合财务和文本数据，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择，在中小企业信用监测中实现比基线方法高18%的轮廓系数，并能识别有意义的聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值财务变量和文本记录）给信用监测带来重大挑战，需要开发能够有效整合多源数据的方法来提升聚类效果和可解释性。

Method: 提出高级谱聚类(ASC)方法：1) 通过优化权重参数整合财务和文本相似度；2) 使用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量；3) 在1428家中小企业数据集上进行评估。

Result: ASC实现比单类型数据基线方法高18%的轮廓系数；识别出有意义模式：51%低风险企业包含'社会招聘'术语；招聘导向中小企业违约风险低30%；在k-means等多种算法中保持稳健性(ΔIntra/Inter < 0.13, Δ轮廓系数 < 0.02)。

Conclusion: ASC成功将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用结合，能够识别有意义的聚类模式，为更有针对性和有效的信用干预提供支持。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Conclusion: IMST模型在准确性、可解释性和计算效率方面均表现优异，具有更简洁的架构和更强的风险检测能力，为中小企业信用评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从图神经网络(GNN)到Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KAN)的知识蒸馏框架SA-DSD，通过改进的FR-KAN+学生模型和自适应加权损失机制，在边缘设备上实现了显著的性能提升和计算效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算环境对模型压缩和推理速度有更高要求，需要将GNN的知识转移到更高效的模型。传统MLP难以捕捉GNN学习的复杂邻域依赖关系，限制了在边缘环境中的性能。

Method: 提出SA-DSD框架：1)改进FR-KAN为FR-KAN+作为学生模型，加入可学习频率基和相移机制；2)基于师生预测一致性构建边界级采样概率矩阵；3)设计自适应加权损失机制来缓解学生模型性能下降。

Result: 在6个真实数据集上的实验显示：SA-DSD相比3个GNN教师模型性能提升3.05%-3.62%，相比FR-KAN+提升15.61%；相比基准模型参数减少16.96倍，推理时间降低55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架有效解决了GNN到高效模型的知识蒸馏问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度和推理时间，适合边缘计算环境部署。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以分析短暂神经事件中的因果交互，且缺乏Python生态系统中易于使用的实现方案。

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Conclusion: ROFT-MOL方法结合了权重插值的易用性和权重集成的性能优势，为分子图基础模型提供了有效的鲁棒微调解决方案，同时适用于回归和分类任务。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Motivation: 电层对GNSS、卫星通信和低轨道操作关键，但电层变异性预测困难，现有模型在强空间天气条件下准确度有限。

Method: 采用时间融合变换器(TFT)模型，整合多种异构输入源(太阳辐照度、地磁指数、GNSS垂直TEC)，应用预处理和时间对齐策略。

Result: 在2010-2025年数据上，模型实现了24小时稳健预测，最低平均根方误差3.33 TECU，太阳EUV辐照度最具预测价值。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还通过注意力机制提供了可解释性，并开源了ionopy工具包以促进重现性和社区发展。

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

Method: 提出层次控制微分方程(H-CDE)框架，包含慢速(退化)和快速(运行)组件，采用多尺度时间积分、可学习路径变换和单调激活函数等创新技术

Result: 在动态响应(桥梁)和稳态(航空发动机)系统中，H-CDE显著超过基线方法，实现了更准确、稳健和可解释的退化推断

Conclusion: H-CDE框架有效解决了退化推断中的数值突性和解耦困难，为工程系统健康监测提供了更可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索的上下文-动作空间中存在高方差问题，现有的MIPS方法虽然利用动作嵌入缓解了这一问题，但未考虑上下文信息且未优化均方误差。

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据中学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，构建最小化均方误差的目标函数。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在均方误差方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过联合学习上下文-动作嵌入有效降低了MIPS估计器的均方误差，为离线策略评估提供了更准确的估计方法。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

TL;DR: VECTOR+是一个结合对比学习和生成模型的框架，用于低数据条件下的药物分子设计，能够生成具有优异结合活性的新颖分子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据条件下，如何有效引导生成模型探索药理学相关的化学空间是药物发现中的主要挑战。

Method: VECTOR+结合属性引导的表征学习和可控分子生成，适用于回归和分类任务，通过对比学习实现数据高效的化学空间探索。

Result: 在PD-L1抑制剂数据集上，生成的8374个分子中有100个超过对接阈值-15.0 kcal/mol，最佳得分-17.6 kcal/mol优于参考抑制剂(-15.4 kcal/mol)。分子动力学模拟证实结合稳定性。在激酶抑制剂上也优于现有药物。

Conclusion: VECTOR+为低数据条件下的属性条件分子设计提供了稳健、可扩展的方法，连接了对比学习和生成建模，实现了可重复的AI加速发现。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DELTA框架，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习解决隐私保护数据重编程问题，在提升预测性能的同时显著降低隐私泄露风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格监管，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私泄露风险，需要新的隐私保护特征转换方法

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现具有下游任务效用的特征转换；第二阶段使用变分LSTM seq2seq编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜空间设计和对抗因果解耦正则化

Result: 在8个数据集上实验显示，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够有效实现隐私感知的数据转换，在保持高预测性能的同时显著降低隐私推断能力

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

TL;DR: MAGN网络将变分模态分解转化为可训练模块，通过展开式VMD和可学习带宽约束，在保持精度的同时大幅提升计算效率，在大型时空预测基准上显著超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠问题，而分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然通过信号分解提高精度，但存在计算效率低和需要手动调参的问题

Method: 提出模式自适应图网络(MAGN)，包含：(1)展开式VMD模块，用固定深度网络替代迭代优化；(2)模式特定的可学习带宽约束，自适应空间异质性并防止频谱重叠

Result: 在LargeST基准(6,902个传感器，2.41亿观测值)上，分解时间减少250倍，预测误差比VMGCN降低85-95%，优于最先进基线方法

Conclusion: MAGN成功将传统信号分解技术转化为可训练的神经网络模块，在保持高精度的同时显著提升计算效率，解决了分解集成方法的计算瓶颈问题

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: BALD-GFlowNet是一种生成式主动学习框架，通过生成流网络直接采样BALD奖励比例的对象，解决了传统池式主动学习在大规模未标记数据集上的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统池式主动学习方法（如BALD）在评估大规模未标记数据集时计算成本过高，特别是在包含数十亿样本的药物发现虚拟筛选中，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）直接按照BALD奖励比例采样对象，用生成式采样替代传统的池式获取方法，使计算复杂度与未标记池大小无关。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet实现了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了结构更多样化的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效可扩展的分子发现提供了有前景的方向，解决了大规模主动学习的计算可扩展性问题。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

*Jingtao Liu,Xinming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAAM方法，通过神经突触调制器动态调节冻结GNN骨干网络的计算流，无需重放数据或微调整个网络，有效解决了持续图学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境和资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续图学习方法面临两个主要问题：1)稳定性-可塑性困境，重放方法往往在两者之间失衡且存储成本高；2)资源密集型预训练，领先的无重放方法严重依赖预训练骨干网络，造成巨大资源负担。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制(TAAM)方法，核心是神经突触调制器(NSM)：1)训练时通过深度复制相似历史调制器初始化新NSM以促进知识迁移；2)推理时为每个任务选择最相关的冻结NSM。NSM插入冻结GNN骨干网络进行细粒度节点注意力调制。

Result: 在六个GCIL基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAAM全面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAAM为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新路径，是一种无重放、资源高效的方法，通过轻量级任务特定模块有效引导GNN的推理过程。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST基于属性融合的分类器存在成员函数建模过于简化和对BPA信念结构利用不充分的问题，影响在复杂实际场景中的效果

Method: 1. 采用选择性模型策略，结合单高斯和高斯混合模型构建成员函数；2. 提出新的可能性分布转BPA方法；3. 将新方法应用于证据K近邻分类器

Result: 在标准数据集上进行综合实验，提出的分类器在准确率上超过最佳现有证据分类器4.84%，且保持低方差，显示了更好的效果和稳健性

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进的模型策略和BPA生成方法，有效解决了传统DST分类器的限制，显著提升了在复杂实际分类任务中的性能和可靠性

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

*Arman Gupta,Govind Waghmare,Gaurav Oberoi,Nitish Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质图（heterophilic graphs）中结合边方向性和表达性消息传递对节点分类的影响，提出了两种架构：多项式表达性GAT基线（Poly）和方向感知变体（Dir-Poly），在五个基准数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图中表现不佳，因为其依赖局部同质邻域。先前研究表明建模边方向性可以提高有效同质性，同时多项式表达性GNN在捕捉高阶特征交互方面显示出潜力。

Method: 提出了两种架构：(1) Poly - 多项式表达性GAT基线，学习输入特征的置换等变高次多项式；(2) Dir-Poly - 方向感知变体，分别聚合入边和出边。两种模型都保持可扩展性且无额外时间复杂度。

Result: 在五个基准异质图数据集上，Poly模型始终优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有固有方向性的图上（如Roman Empire）提供额外增益，达到最先进结果。但在无向图上引入人工方向性并不总是有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了边方向和表达性特征建模在异质图学习中的互补作用，方向性消息传递的益处是上下文相关的。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

TL;DR: ProCause是一个新的生成式方法，用于评估规范性过程监测方法，通过整合多种因果推理架构和时序模型来解决RealCause方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法在评估规范性过程监测方法时存在两个主要问题：忽略了过程数据中的时序依赖性，以及仅依赖单一的TARNet因果推理模型架构，限制了评估效果。

Method: 提出了ProCause方法，支持序列模型（如LSTM）和非序列模型，并整合了多种因果推理架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）。

Result: 研究发现TARNet并非总是最佳选择，集成模型提供更一致的可靠性，当存在时序依赖性时，使用LSTM可以改善评估效果。通过真实世界数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性。

Conclusion: ProCause为规范性过程监测方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，通过多架构集成和时序建模能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证表明，Causal SHAP能够降低仅与目标相关但不具因果关系的特征归因分数

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI领域提供了实用的因果感知模型解释框架，特别适用于医疗等需要理解真实因果关系的决策场景

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Motivation: 传统人才识别方法依赖人工流程、过于关注学业成绩且干预时机较晚，忽视了非学术才能和早期干预机会。

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络（Transformer+LSTM+ANN），基于1041名中学生的离线教育数据，通过聚类奖项记录和提取学习行为特征来预测7种才能类型。

Result: 模型取得了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC值，表现出优秀的预测性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够早期识别学生多样化才能，为教育干预提供了新的技术手段。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次计算成本的交叉令牌混合，同时保持轻量级线性更新，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在所有层对所有令牌统一应用二次自注意力计算，导致计算成本高昂。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，为大多数令牌将注意力成本降低到线性。通过路由机制，只有约10%的令牌需要通过完整的注意力计算。

Result: DTRNet在匹配FLOPs的情况下，在准确性和内存使用方面均优于MoD和D-LLM等基于路由的层跳过方法，同时路由到完整注意力的令牌更少。效率增益随序列长度扩展，对长上下文输入显著减少FLOPs。

Conclusion: 通过将令牌更新与注意力混合解耦，DTRNet大幅减少了二次计算份额，为Transformer提供了简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络中特征叠加现象，通过控制实验发现宽度增加会产生相位模式，拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点特征中，更锐利的池化能提高轴对齐并减少通道共享，浅层模型可能陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释图神经网络很困难，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐。研究GNN潜在空间中的特征叠加现象，即多个特征共享方向的问题。

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的控制实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，然后用简单的基不变诊断分析其几何特性。测试了GCN/GIN/GAT等多种GNN架构。

Result: 发现宽度增加会产生重叠的相位模式；拓扑结构将重叠印记到节点级特征中，池化操作部分重新混合成任务对齐的图形轴；更锐利的池化增加轴对齐并减少通道共享；浅层模型可能陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入状态。

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择（宽度、池化和最终层激活）联系起来，并为设计更可解释的GNN提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种混合架构，通过分段压缩和稀疏注意力机制，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时显著降低计算和内存成本，在长序列任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型如Mamba和滑动窗口注意力虽然计算高效，但可能因无法保留远距离令牌的详细信息而导致长序列性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：1）使用线性局部混合器（Mamba或SWA）在固定大小的段内压缩令牌；2）每个令牌稀疏地关注少量压缩的检查点令牌来总结输入历史；3）仅在这些压缩表示上应用注意力。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务中优于强基线；在4亿和13亿参数规模上，在语言建模和常识推理任务中匹配全注意力Transformer；相比SOTA模型具有更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过混合压缩和稀疏注意力设计，在保持接近全注意力性能的同时实现了亚二次方的内存增长，为长序列处理提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出自适应重采样训练方法ART，基于类别性能动态调整训练数据分布，在类别不平衡分类任务中显著优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布，忽略了类别学习难度的变化，限制了模型性能

Method: 使用类别级宏F1分数定期更新训练数据分布，自适应地调整对表现不佳类别的关注度

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于SMOTE、NearMiss等传统方法，平均提升宏F1分数2.64个百分点

Conclusion: ART是一种可靠的不平衡分类方法，能够一致地提供最佳性能，优于现有方法

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Result: 在SuperGLUE基准测试中优于多个最先进的参数高效基线方法，平均准确率提升1.94%，同时显著减少79.25%的激活提示。

Conclusion: MEPT提供了一个有效且高效的流形映射框架，其有效性得到了流形学习理论见解和神经激活通路可视化结果的支持。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然具有并行生成和任意顺序推理的优势，但无法支持token插入，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其在实际应用中的灵活性

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，FlexMDM通过插入掩码token并逐步去掩码的方式来生成可变长度序列，同时保留了MDMs的任意顺序推理能力

Result: FlexMDM在困惑度上与MDM相当，但能更好地建模长度统计特性；在迷宫规划任务上成功率比MDM基线高约60%；将LLaDA-8B微调为FlexMDM后，在GSM8K数学推理任务上从58%提升到67%，代码填充性能从52%提升到65%

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了MDM固定长度生成的限制，实现了可变长度序列的高效生成，同时保持了并行推理的优势，在多个任务上展现出显著性能提升

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Conclusion: RefineStat通过结合语义约束和诊断感知细化，有效解决了小型语言模型在概率编程中的错误问题，为统计模型发现提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将performative prediction推广到非线性情况，保持了关键理论性质，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 自适应深度消息传递机制能有效提升GNN性能，解决了固定层数消息传递的局限性

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过将随机建模思想融入xLSTM架构，成功提升了时间序列建模的性能，为处理复杂时间动态提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL)损失函数，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵差异来保持向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维过程会扭曲向量空间的关键属性（如正交性和线性独立性），这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。需要一种方法来在降维过程中保持这些几何关系。

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)，通过比较高维数据和低维嵌入的Gram矩阵或余弦相似度矩阵的差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影。该方法基于矩阵扰动理论推导误差边界。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL能够在减少嵌入维度的同时，在很大程度上保持下游任务的性能，这归因于其对关键向量空间属性的保持。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维任务，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐、迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解学习的物理机制提供了新视角，推动了生物智能与人工智能系统的对齐发展，在保持训练精度的同时显著提升了对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

Conclusion: MPC超越了表达能力理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致入微的框架，有效缩小了理论与实践之间的差距

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略结合显式推理指令能有效提升LLMs的系统泛化能力，特别是在数学推理任务中，简单示例比复杂示例更有利于泛化。

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Conclusion: E-UNO作为复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构，实现了准确且物理一致的预测。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化（特别是校准的预测区间），临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，这限制了在医疗保健中的部署。

Result: 在两个大型公共数据集（分钟级和小时级采样）上的实验表明，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于conformal prediction基线，而KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间在提供可解释、不确定性感知的生命体征预测方面具有临床前景，能够支持更可靠的临床决策。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

TL;DR: DEPO是一种数据高效策略优化方法，通过离线高质量数据筛选和在线动态样本过滤，显著降低RLVR训练成本并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模推理模型的强化学习方法需要大量计算和数据集，导致训练成本高且数据效率低

Method: 结合离线阶段基于多样性、影响力和适当难度的高质量数据筛选，以及在线阶段基于探索性指标的动态样本过滤和重放机制

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法，仅用20%训练数据就能在AIME24和AIME25上分别实现1.85倍和1.66倍加速

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效的数据选择策略有效解决了RLVR训练中的数据效率问题，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更经济的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

TL;DR: FMAE是一个灵活的预训练框架，能够处理电池数据中的缺失通道并捕捉数据片段间的相互关联，为多任务电池管理提供统一表征，显著减少数据和工程需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级电池管理涉及多种任务，每种任务使用不同时间尺度、传感器分辨率和数据通道的数据。构建特定任务方法需要大量数据和工程努力，限制了智能电池管理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出灵活掩码自编码器（FMAE）框架，能够学习缺失电池数据通道，捕捉数据片段间的相互关联，从异构数据中学习统一电池表征。

Result: FMAE在5个电池管理任务和11个电池数据集上始终优于所有特定任务方法。在剩余寿命预测任务中，使用50倍少的推理数据仍保持最先进结果。即使真实数据缺少某些信息（如系统电压），FMAE仍能应用且性能影响很小。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了一条实现灵活、数据高效模型的实用路径，简化了动态系统的真实世界多任务管理。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Method: 计算统计力学配分函数的渐近级数系数，通过Borel变换识别奇点，这些奇点与临界目标函数值一一对应

Result: 该方法能够提供理论上有依据的目标值，指导局部优化器进行学习率调整和逃离次优区域

Conclusion: 该框架为优化提供了基于景观几何的全局指导，不同于启发式自适应方法

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的雨量预报模型主要依靠其成功指数(CSI)作为优化准则，但CSI在长期无雨时效果差，需要更有效的损失函数来提升预报准确性。

Method: 提出简单的罚款表达式，将其重新解释为二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)形式，然后通过近似处理改造为可微分的AT损失函数。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种更有效的雨量预报损失函数，能够更好地处理长期无雨情况，为机器学习方法在气象预报领域的应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效减少混淆偏差，通过因果分析改善时空轨迹预测等任务的性能

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源的中文医疗语言模型训练流程主要关注训练方法优化，但缺乏对训练数据处理的全面探索，需要解决指令内容不足和隐私保护问题。

Method: DPF-CM包含两个核心模块：1）训练数据处理管道，采用链式示例上下文学习策略生成问题导向指令，以及基于集成奖励模型的偏好数据筛选机制；2）部署隐私保护模块，通过隐私保护向量数据库（PPVD）的四个关键阶段来防止训练数据泄露。

Conclusion: 该框架为中文医疗大语言模型的训练和部署提供了全面的数据处理解决方案，有效解决了指令内容缺乏和隐私保护的关键问题，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Result: CbLDM相比现有模型展现出显著更高的预测精度，证明了其在解决纳米结构逆向问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: CbLDM能够有效解决纳米结构逆向问题，并具有处理其他连续条件生成任务的潜力。

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 传统消息传递架构在节点和图预测任务中难以充分建模长距离依赖关系，需要新的方法来有效处理大图并捕获长距离依赖。

Method: 利用层次图结构和自适应随机游走，引入可学习的转移概率来决定游走是偏好原始图还是跨越层次捷径。

Result: 在合成长距离任务上，该方法能够超越仅基于原始拓扑的传统方法的理论限制，偏好层次结构的游走可以达到与原始图上更长游走相同的性能。

Conclusion: 这些初步发现为高效处理大图同时有效捕获长距离依赖开辟了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

<details>

Motivation: VQ-VAE等离散潜空间深度生成模型虽然具有优秀的数据生成能力，但由于潜空间过大，其概率推理被认为不可处理。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过选择高概率潜变量子集，将VQ-VAE蒸馏为概率电路模型，利用VQ-VAE通常未充分利用其潜空间的特性来实现高效蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明该方法在密度估计和条件生成任务中具有竞争性性能，挑战了VQ-VAE作为固有不可处理模型的传统观点。

Conclusion: VQ-VAE可以通过简单的蒸馏策略转化为可处理模型，在保持表达力的同时提供可处理的概率推理能力。

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

Motivation: IDCS分类器在信用评分中能提高成本效率，但其对模型解释稳定性的影响尚未被研究，而监管对透明度的要求日益增加。

Method: 使用四个公开信用评分数据集，评估IDCS分类器的判别能力和成本效率，并通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名在不同类别不平衡程度下的稳定性。

Result: IDCS分类器提高了成本效率，但相比传统模型产生了显著不稳定的解释，特别是在类别不平衡增加时。

Conclusion: 在信用评分中，成本优化和可解释性之间存在关键权衡，需要解决IDCS分类器的稳定性问题以确保成本优势不被不可靠的解释所削弱。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架有效解决了神经算子的外推限制，实现了无需重新训练的参数外推泛化，为参数化PDE求解提供了物理约束保持的加速方案。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

Motivation: 现有运动描述方法需要高级描述标注的运动数据，但现有数据集缺乏这种标注和低级详细描述，限制了模型的性能。

Method: 1）使用大语言模型为高级描述生成详细的低级描述标注；2）推出基于检索的机制，将详细描述与外部文本源中的高级描述对齐，结合运动特征生成准确的高级描述。

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本源的知识，特别是对于现有数据集未覆盖的运动，显著提高了运动描述的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪重放的半监督持续学习框架，用于解决心电图信号分析中的类别不平衡和数据存储问题，通过GAN生成伪数据来维持历史知识并检测新异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图自动分析在临床实践中很重要，但面临类别不平衡和数据存储负担的问题。某些ECG信号样本有限，且随着患者数据增长，存储所有历史数据用于训练变得困难。

Method: 提出伪重放半监督持续学习框架，包含无监督识别和重放检测两个组件。使用无监督GAN检测新模式，通过生成器学习每个任务的数据分布，生成伪数据代表先前学习的类别，使模型能同时检测现有模式和新异常。

Result: 在四个公共ECG数据集上验证了框架有效性，实验结果表明该方法在识别新异常的同时，对现有ECG信号的检测保持了良好性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升异常检测性能并解决存储限制问题，在ECG信号分析中表现出很好的应用前景。

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法依赖反向传播和梯度优化，计算密集且不适合资源受限环境。

Method: 使用CMA-ES优化输入层提示嵌入，通过非线性随机投影和递归最小二乘法将任务特定知识编码到知识编码矩阵中，实现分类器的增量更新。

Result: FoRo显著降低了平均遗忘率并提高了准确性，同时减少了内存使用和运行时间，在长任务序列中保持高知识保留率。

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了一个有前景的方向，特别适用于对效率和效果都有要求的实际多媒体应用场景。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现图对比学习(GCL)在标准数据集上的优势被高估，未经训练的GNN、简单MLP甚至手工统计特征都能达到或超过GCL性能。GCL的优势高度依赖于数据集大小和任务难度，只有在足够大的分子数据集上才显现优势，且性能会达到平台期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑当前图对比学习(GCL)在标准基准测试中的实际性能优势，探究GCL相比未训练基线方法的真实有效性。

Method: 通过在不同规模的标准数据集、大型分子数据集(ogbg-molhiv)和合成数据集上，比较GCL与未训练GNN、多层感知机以及手工统计特征的性能表现。

Result: 在标准数据集上，未训练基线方法能与GCL匹敌甚至超越；在大型分子数据集上，GCL只有在样本量超过数千个时才显现优势，但最终会达到性能平台期；在合成数据集上，GCL准确率随图数量对数增长，性能差距随任务复杂度变化。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估基准测试中数据集规模的作用，并设计能够避免性能平台期的GCL算法，数据集大小是影响GCL有效性的关键因素。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Motivation: 条件流匹配(CFM)在生成建模中表现出色，但缺乏精确控制生成样本的方法。现有引导方法如梯度引导、序列蒙特卡洛等主要针对扩散模型，尚未扩展到流匹配方法。

Method: 将精确控制需求表述为用能量势倾斜输出分布，首次推导出适用于CFM的Feynman-Kac引导方法。在合成任务和高维空间倾斜分布生成中进行评估。

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM为精确控制生成样本提供了有效方法，特别在化学反应的过渡态生成中解决了手性约束问题，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多的微调模型公开可用，模型合并的安全性受到关注。未经授权的合并可能侵犯开发者权益并泄露敏感个人信息。现有方法主要检测合并模型是否源自特定源模型，但无法有效防止非法合并。

Method: 利用Transformer模型中注意力机制的固有对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用于Query-Key和Value-Output分支，保持模型输出不变的同时将其推离其他微调模型的共享参数空间。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的大量实验表明，当受保护模型参与合并时，MergeLock能将合并模型的性能降低95%以上。受保护的合并模型无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock提供了一种有效的主动保护机制，能够直接防止未经授权的模型合并，增强了对非法合并的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的提升建模方法通常忽略干扰效应（一个物品的处理会影响其他物品的结果），这违反了SUTVA假设，导致在真实市场环境中制定次优策略。现有的干扰感知估计器如AddIPW尚未应用于提升建模文献，且基于这些估计器的策略优化方法尚未完善。

Method: 使用AddIPW估计器作为可微分学习目标，适用于基于梯度的优化。将该框架与成熟的响应转换技术结合，直接优化增量利润等经济结果。通过模拟实验验证方法有效性。

Result: 模拟实验表明，该方法显著优于忽略干扰的方法，特别是在干扰效应增强时表现更佳。将利润中心化的提升策略适配到该框架中，能够更好地识别最高影响力的干预措施。

Conclusion: 该方法为更有利可图的激励个性化提供了一条实用路径，通过处理干扰效应和直接优化经济指标，实现了更好的促销优化效果。

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

Motivation: 移动和可穿戴传感技术虽然能够连续监测情感和压力，但结合生态自我报告问卷时面临数据缺失和不规则时间采样的挑战，需要有效的时间依赖建模方法

Method: 开发Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门设计用于处理不规则间隔的自我报告数据，捕捉时间序列中的时间依赖性

Conclusion: 研究强调了在处理不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入表示的重要性，Ema2Vec方法为此类问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Motivation: 聚类联邦学习(CFL)领域存在许多偏离标准FL假设的问题，且目前研究较少。需要一种能够自动化检测聚类时机的方法来提高个性化模型的效果。

Method: 提出OCFL算法，基于客户端梯度的余弦距离计算和温度测量来检测联邦模型收敛时机。该算法与聚类方法无关，能够自动化识别最早适合聚类的时刻。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上进行了40多个任务的实验验证，显示了OCFL在自动化进行CFL时的良好性能。同时证明了基于密度的聚类方法在区分不同分布神经网络损失面时的高效性。

Conclusion: OCFL提供了一种无需手动调整超参数的自动化CFL解决方案，通过GradCAM局部解释方法进一步揭示了个性化与模型可解释性之间的关系，为聚类联邦学习的实际应用提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Conclusion: 该框架通过课程学习和多任务学习的结合，有效提升了移动性预测的准确性和训练效率。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Conclusion: 分布偏差是梯度因果发现方法的重要挑战，但通过适当的方法设计（如消除因果分解竞争）可以有效控制这些偏差，提高因果学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

Motivation: 分布式轨迹优化算法ADMM-DDP需要大量手动调整紧密耦合的超参数，这些参数共同影响局部任务性能和全局协调效果，调参过程繁琐且困难。

Method: 提出L2C框架，使用轻量级神经网络建模超参数，通过端到端分布式方式对ADMM-DDP流程进行微分，重用DDP组件加速元梯度计算，采用截断迭代和元学习ADMM惩罚参数来加速训练。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 蒸馏训练在LLM预训练中重新兴起，研究发现它能显著改善测试时缩放性能，但会损害上下文学习能力，特别是在归纳头方面。通过二元模型沙盒分析揭示了这些现象背后的共同因素。

Motivation: 探索蒸馏训练对现代LLM关键能力（如测试时缩放和上下文学习）的影响，这些方面在以往研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用蒸馏方法进行预训练，通过二元模型沙盒实验来隔离和分析观察到的现象背后的共同因素。

Result: 蒸馏预训练显著改善了测试时缩放性能，但损害了上下文学习能力，特别是归纳头建模的能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了蒸馏训练的利弊，为实践者提供了预训练设计选择的指导，需要在测试时缩放和上下文学习能力之间进行权衡。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一系列受Transformer启发的DeepONet变体，通过双向交叉条件化技术提升算子学习的效果，在保持简单性的同时实现了更高的准确性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DeepONet框架中简单性与准确性的争议，"香草"DeepONet简单高效但准确性低，修改版本准确性高但训练时间长。

Method: 提出Transformer风格的双向交叉条件化技术，在分支网络中注入查询点信息，在主干网络中注入输入函数信息，实现动态依赖关系。

Result: 在4个PDE标准测试中（平流、扩散-反应、Burgers、KdV方程），都有变体能够达到或超越修改版DeepONet的准确性，同时提升训练效率。最佳变体与方程特性自然匹配。

Conclusion: 交叉条件化技术的效果依赖于方程的特性和物理机制，通过统计分析验证了方法的稳健性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示大模型的ML工程代理无法通过经验改进性能，需要探索通过强化学习让较小模型持续提升能力的方法。

Method: 提出分布式异步RL框架中的时长感知梯度更新来优化可变时长动作，并通过环境插装技术提供部分奖励反馈，使用静态语言模型插入打印语句来记录实验进度。

Result: 在MLEBench上的实验表明，使用RL训练的Qwen2.5-3B模型平均性能比使用Claude-3.5-Sonnet的代理框架高出22%。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和环境插装技术，较小模型能够超越静态大模型，证明了经验学习和持续改进在ML工程代理中的重要性。

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车队和共享车辆系统中微小损伤检测的挑战，传统人工检测劳动密集且易出错，现有图像方法无法实时检测且难以发现底盘损伤

Method: 开发多模态自编码器架构，集成IMU和麦克风传感器到挡风玻璃安装的紧凑设备中，采用集成池化多模态模型

Result: 集成池化多模态模型达到92% ROC-AUC的最高性能，证明在实际应用中的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到其他应用领域，如提高汽车安全性（与安全气囊系统集成）和辅助自动驾驶车辆的碰撞检测

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中显著优于现有方法（相对提升至少17%），计算资源需求大幅减少，推理速度比GPT-4o方法快5-60倍

Conclusion: SoLS通过智能区分正负样本的更新策略，有效解决了基础模型RL训练中的关键挑战，实现了高效且稳定的性能提升

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的CMMN方法，通过两种新的源参考频谱计算方法来提升EEG信号处理效果，显著改善了独立成分分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG记录包含丰富的神经活动信息，但受到伪影、噪声以及传感器、放大器和滤波等设备差异的影响。现有的独立成分分析和自动标记方法需要更好的频谱归一化技术来提升性能。

Method: 提出了CMMN方法的扩展版本，采用两种替代方法计算源参考频谱：(1)通道平均和L1归一化重心；(2)寻找与目标受试者频谱最接近的源受试者的主体间映射方法。该方法产生时空可分离滤波器，可在不同通道数的数据集间映射。

Result: 在独立成分分类任务中应用这些滤波器，显示在识别大脑与非大脑独立成分方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过适当的频谱归一化滤波，能够最小化记录设备和环境噪声差异对机器学习模型性能的影响，对癫痫和精神疾病等神经病理学的EEG诊断和监测具有临床意义。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏置缓解技术存在"降级效应"，即在改善弱势群体结果的同时会降低优势群体的性能表现。需要一种方法能够在缓解偏置的同时保持模型的整体性能。

Method: 将偏置缓解重新定义为持续学习问题，借鉴Learning without Forgetting和Elastic Weight Consolidation等技术，通过领域增量持续学习的方式让模型适应变化的公平性条件。

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上的实验表明，该框架能够有效缓解偏置，同时最小化原始知识的损失，实现了公平性和性能的平衡。

Conclusion: BM-CL框架将公平性和持续学习领域相结合，为开发既公平又有效的机器学习系统提供了一条有前景的途径。

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 提出的高效联邦LLM蒸馏方案成功解决了高维logits传输的通信瓶颈，为带宽受限环境下的联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Conclusion: STORI基准和随机性分类法填补了现有研究的空白，为系统评估强化学习在随机环境中的鲁棒性提供了重要工具

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架有效解决了传统CP方法的数据效率和计算复杂度问题，为可靠的不确定性量化提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

*Qifu Wen,Xi Zeng,Zihan Zhou,Shuaijun Liu,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早期停止方法，通过在Transformer组件级别监控梯度收敛来替代全局验证损失监控，显著加速训练并提高泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早停方法需要全局验证推理，计算成本高昂。不同Transformer组件在微调过程中收敛速度不同，需要更细粒度的停止策略

Method: 在Transformer的注意力投影和FFN层矩阵中跟踪反向传播梯度幅度。当某个投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独停止该矩阵的更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习

Result: 训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，平均准确率提高1.2%，同时通过早期防止过拟合来增强泛化能力

Conclusion: GradES提供了一种计算高效的早停方法，通过在组件级别智能冻结参数，既加速训练又改善模型性能

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于权重的特征分析技术存在性能下降和数据效率低的问题，需要直接从神经网络权重中推导有意义特征的方法

Method: 设计SQS激活函数，专门用于Gated Linear Units (GLUs)，支持基于权重的可解释性分析

Result: SQS在性能上与最先进的激活函数竞争，同时实现了基于权重的可解释性

Conclusion: SQS激活函数成功解决了现有技术的缺陷，在保持高性能的同时提供了更好的模型可解释性

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

Motivation: 结合固定路线公交的成本效益和需求响应式运输的适应性，改善低密度地区的交通可达性，解决公共交通第一/最后一英里问题

Method: 使用深度强化学习（近端策略优化算法）动态分配车辆到灵活路线区域，基于实时需求波动进行分区调度控制，通过基于代理的仿真在真实公交线路上验证

Result: 经过有效训练的RL模型使半按需服务比传统固定路线服务多服务16%乘客，平均成本高13%；RL控制带来2.4%更多乘客和1.4%更高成本

Conclusion: 展示了将SAV接驳车和机器学习技术整合到公共交通中的潜力，为多模式交通系统中解决第一/最后一英里问题奠定了创新基础

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机器学习分析NCAP数据，发现车辆基本特征（车重和车型年份）对预测5星安全评级最重要，但ADAS功能也有显著贡献，随机森林模型达到89.18%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NCAP安全评级从被动安全扩展到包含ADAS主动安全技术，需要实证研究这些系统如何相互作用，以及它们与车辆基本特征共同预测最高安全评级的能力。

Method: 使用包含5,128个车辆变体的NCAP数据集，比较逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和支持向量机四种模型，采用5折分层交叉验证，并对最佳模型进行超参数优化。

Result: 随机森林和梯度提升表现最佳，优化后的随机森林在测试集上达到89.18%准确率和0.9586 ROC AUC。特征重要性分析显示车重和车型年份贡献超过55%的预测能力，ADAS特征也有意义贡献。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效分析大规模NCAP数据，传统车辆参数和现代ADAS特征共同对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值，为消费者和监管机构提供重要见解。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机投影矩阵，选择性地正则化高波动性的输入和隐藏节点，从而提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法（如均匀噪声注入或固定dropout率）无法根据网络内部动态调整正则化强度，无法有效处理不同节点和输入的梯度波动性差异。

Method: VISP通过计算梯度统计量来量化波动性，并利用该信息动态缩放随机投影矩阵，选择性地对高波动性的输入和隐藏节点施加更强的正则化，同时保持稳定表示。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法能持续提升泛化性能。分析显示VISP能稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过利用梯度波动性信息进行自适应正则化，有效缓解过拟合问题，提高深度神经网络的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)虽然能自动优化架构设计，但计算成本高昂，特别是在多目标优化场景下。需要一种更高效的方法来减少计算负担。

Method: 采用自适应协同克里金辅助的多保真度多目标NAS算法，结合聚类局部采样策略和新型连续编码方法，降低搜索维度并提高效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的NAS算法不仅计算效率高，而且能够独立发现文献中优秀的U-Net架构设计原则，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Motivation: 准确评估数据集复杂度对于知识图谱链接预测模型的比较至关重要，但现有的CSG指标在链接预测场景中的有效性需要验证

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准上（如FB15k-237、WN18RR），通过系统改变CSG计算的两个关键参数（M：每类蒙特卡洛采样点数，K：嵌入空间中最近邻数量）来评估CSG的行为特性

Result: CSG对参数K的选择高度敏感，无法随目标类别数量自然扩展；CSG值与标准性能指标（如平均倒数排名MRR）相关性弱或无相关性；在链接预测设置中CSG的稳定性和泛化预测能力失效

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要开发更鲁棒、分类器无关的复杂度度量方法来进行知识图谱链接预测评估，CSG在当前形式下不适合作为可靠的复杂度指标

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Method: 构建预测编码模型来模拟新皮层功能，测试其在自联想记忆任务中的表现，分析不同训练样本数量下的记忆能力

Conclusion: 新皮层可以使用密集重叠表征逐步编码个别示例，但数量有限，这支持了海马体稀疏模式分离表征的必要性

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: 提出的PT-BPS算法为多模态贝叶斯推断问题提供了更有效的采样解决方案，具有参数设置简单和收敛快的优势。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency

Motivation: 标准的静态监护模型只能检测预定义的害害类别，无法满足不同应用域的自定义需求，需要更灵活的监管方案

Method: 开发动态监护模型，支持用户自定义政策评估，提供两种使用模式：快速检测模式和链式思维推理模式（说明和证成输出）

Conclusion: 动态监护模型提供了灵活、高效的监管解决方案，能够满足多样化的应用场景需求，是对标准静态监护模型的有力补充

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Conclusion: 维度修复程序使算法能够探索更广泛的规则结构，同时保持维度一致性，为设计更有效和可解释的医疗预约规则提供了新思路

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

Motivation: 解决优化器比较中的两个方法论问题：(i)不平等的超参数调优和(ii)有限或误导性的评估设置，以确保公平的性能比较

Method: 对四个模型规模(0.1B-1.2B参数)和数据-模型比例(1-8x Chinchilla最优值)进行系统性研究，涉及十种深度学习优化器的严格超参数调优和训练结束后评估

Result: 发现矩阵基优化器(Muon、Soap等)速度提升随模型规模增大而减小：从0.1B模型的1.4倍降至1.2B模型的1.1倍，实际速度提升低于之前声称的2倍

Conclusion: 公平的优化器比较需要严格的超参数调优、多模型规模范围测试和训练完成后评估，矩阵基优化器在大模型上的优势有限

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的双层优化框架，通过数据流形曲率来量化个体敏感性，在保持数据效用性的同时提高对成员推断攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接共享原始数据存在显著隐私风险，而现有隐私保护技术往往以杀害数据质量为代价。平衡隐私保护与数据效用性仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层任务通过识别器确保数据质量，下层任务利用数据流形曲率量化个体容易受攻击的程度，并向低曲率区域激洞以提高隐私性。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法不仅提高了对成员推断攻击的抵御能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过交替优化隐私和效用性目标，实现了两者的协同平衡，为隐私保护数据共享提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够模拟大气三维结构、响应气候变化强迫、同时保持计算效率和长期稳定性的气候模拟器，以支持快速实验和耦合气候动力学研究。

Method: 基于原始LUCIE-2D框架，采用球面傅里叶神经算子(SFNO)骨干网络，使用30年ERA5再分析数据在8个垂直σ层上进行训练，整合CO2作为强迫变量，并可选择集成预设海表温度(SST)。

Result: LUCIE-3D成功再现了气候学平均值、变异性和长期气候变化信号，包括CO2浓度增加下的地表增温和平流层冷却。模型还捕捉了赤道开尔文波、马登-朱利安振荡和环状模等关键动力学过程，并在极端事件统计中表现出可信行为。

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D结合了稳定性、物理一致性和可访问性，是快速实验、消融研究和耦合气候动力学探索的宝贵工具，在古气候研究和未来地球系统模拟方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)作为预处理步骤，为每个数据点估计噪声尺度σ，然后用这些数据依赖的σ值训练分数模型，将局部数据几何融入去噪过程

Result: 经验评估表明该方法在多个指标上获得了一致的改进

Conclusion: 数据感知的sigma预测对于稀疏高维设置中的生成建模具有重要意义

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Conclusion: 这种协同策略是专门化、不平衡分类任务中强力微调的高效替代方案，验证了该方法的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Conclusion: CIML框架通过同时利用共同和独特信息，突破了传统多视图冗余假设的限制，在多视图学习中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Result: 该方法在多任务数量增加时保持稳健性能， consistently outperforms prior work。

Conclusion: 提出的基于Jensen-Shannon散度的模型融合方法有效解决了多任务学习中的任务干扰问题，为模型融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Conclusion: 该方法使EM算法能够集成到现代深度学习框架中，为高斯混合模型的Wasserstein距离计算提供了实用的可微分实现，在多个应用场景中展现出良好的性能。

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset

nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau

\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与训练集类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别代表性不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE模型，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，使用γ-功率散度推导的闭式目标进行优化，并推导等权重潜在混合Student's t分布用于类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE相比$t^3$VAE和高斯基VAE基线，在严重类别不平衡情况下获得更低的FID分数，在每类F1评估中也优于条件高斯VAE。

Conclusion: 在严重类别不平衡场景下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著改善了生成公平性和多样性，而高斯基模型在轻度不平衡情况下仍具有竞争力。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

*Pieter Smet*

TL;DR: 本文研究了预测-优化方法中预测误差对解质量的影响，通过模拟多分类器预测来实验分析预测误差与最优解接近度之间的非平凡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测-优化方法假设更准确的预测会产生更接近实际最优解的方案，但在复杂约束优化问题中这一假设缺乏实证支持，需要系统分析预测误差对解质量的影响。

Method: 提出了模拟多分类器预测的新算法，扩展了现有的二分类模拟方法，并通过计算实验评估算法性能，应用于机器调度问题的预测-优化算法评估。

Result: 分类器性能可以以合理精度进行模拟，但存在一定变异性；实验显示预测误差与解接近最优程度的关系是非平凡的，并非简单的线性关系。

Conclusion: 机器学习预测在决策系统中的设计和评估需要充分考虑预测误差与解质量之间的复杂关系，模拟方法为分析这种关系提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

TL;DR: DaCe AD是一个无需代码修改的自动微分引擎，使用ILP算法优化存储与重计算权衡，在HPC基准测试中比JAX快92倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AD框架存在编程语言支持有限、需要代码修改、科学计算性能不足、存储策略简单等问题，迫使领域科学家手动计算大型问题的梯度

Method: 使用基于ILP的新算法优化存储和重计算的权衡，在给定内存约束下实现最大性能，无需代码修改

Result: 在NPBench HPC基准测试套件上，平均比最先进的JAX框架快92倍以上，且无需任何代码更改

Conclusion: DaCe AD提供了一个通用高效的自动微分解决方案，解决了现有AD框架的主要局限性，特别适用于科学计算和机器学习集成应用

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种动态验证框架，通过惩病人模拟器和临床评价标准生成器，训练出了医疗增强理由模型Baichuan-M2，在HealthBench评测中超过其他开源模型和大部分闭源模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型在静态测试中表现优异，但在真实临床决策中存在差距，因为传统考试无法模拟医疗询诉的动态互动特性。

Method: 建立大规模高保真互动强化学习系统，包含惩病人模拟器（使用去识别化医疗记录）和临床评价标准生成器（动态产生多维度评估指标），通过改进的组相对策略优化算法训练32B参数的Baichuan-M2模型。

Result: 在HealthBench评测中，Baichuan-M2超过所有其他开源模型和大部分先进闭源模型，在极具挑战性的HealthBench Hard测试中获得超过32分的成绩，之前仅有GPT-5能达到这一水平。

Conclusion: 稳健的动态验证系统对于将大语言模型能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了新的性能-参数比优势方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有的多变量时间序列预测方法主要关注单一空间或时间尺度的依赖关系建模，但无法有效捕捉跨多个时空尺度的复杂高阶依赖关系。

Method: 提出ST-Hyper方法，包含时空金字塔建模模块提取多尺度特征，自适应超图建模模块学习稀疏超图来捕捉鲁棒的高阶依赖，并通过三相超图传播进行特征交互。

Result: 在6个真实世界MTS数据集上的实验表明，ST-Hyper在长期和短期预测上分别实现了平均3.8%和6.8%的MAE降低，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过超图建模有效捕捉了多尺度时空动态依赖，证明了在多元时间序列预测中建模跨时空尺度高阶依赖的重要性。

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Motivation: 解决简单机器人群体（Ant Robots）在复杂灾难响应环境中因有限传感、无通信和分散控制而面临的群体凝聚和碎片化问题，特别是在时间紧急的救火等场景中需要快速有效的群体协作。

Method: 提出VariAntNet深度学习模型，包括从无序变长局部观测中提取几何特征，使用基于可见性图拉普拉斯矩阵特性的新型可微分多目标损失函数来促进群体凝聚，并在仅方位有限距离传感的智能体聚集任务上进行验证。

Result: VariAntNet显著优于现有解析方法，收敛速度提高一倍以上，同时在不同群体规模下保持高连接性，解决了解析方法虽然保证凝聚但速度过慢的问题。

Conclusion: 在时间关键的应急响应场景中，VariAntNet提供了速度与群体完整性之间的有效权衡，证明了深度学习在分散控制中的实用性，即使可能损失部分智能体也比缓慢的解析方法更实用。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习中概率预测的普及，如何解释预测概率并评估预测器的性能成为一个重要问题。校准作为经典概念，需要重新审视其定义和测量方法。

Method: 采用统一视角，将校准视为预测器假设的世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的不可区分性。通过各类区分器或统计度量来量化两个世界的可区分程度。

Result: 提出了校准作为不可区分性的统一框架，各种校准度量方法可以量化预测世界与真实世界之间的差异程度。

Conclusion: 校准误差的测量应该反映预测器假设的概率分布与真实分布之间的不可区分性，这对下游决策者使用预测结果进行决策具有重要意义。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: 提出UDI方法解决多模态学习中模态不平衡问题，通过单向动态交互替代传统联合损失，实现更好的模态协同和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态联合学习会导致模态不平衡，强模态压制弱模态，限制了各模态信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用

Method: UDI方法：先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后用其学习表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态，动态调整模态交互，实现解耦优化和定向信息流

Result: 实验结果表明UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中带来性能提升

Conclusion: UDI通过放弃传统联合损失，采用主动顺序训练方案，有效解决了模态不平衡问题，促进了跨模态特征学习

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架具有广泛适用性，可应用于处理系统提前期报价、k-服务器问题和可重用资源分配等多种在线决策场景

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Conclusion: 提出的马尔可夫链文本过采样方法能够有效处理文本分类中的类别不平衡问题，特别是在严重不平衡场景下具有竞争优势。

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了模型无关的训练停止准则，无需单独的验证数据集，在真实物理场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

TL;DR: VASSO方法通过抑制方差来稳定SAM中的对抗扰动，避免过度友好的对抗样本，从而提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM方法虽然能通过寻找平坦最小值来提升泛化能力，但在实践中存在对抗扰动过于友好的问题，限制了泛化性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制扰动方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，可与SAM及其计算高效变体结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上验证了VASSO+SAM组合的优越泛化性能，并在计算效率SAM变体上实现了理想的泛化-计算权衡。

Conclusion: VASSO提供了一种通用的对抗扰动稳定方法，能有效提升SAM的泛化能力，同时保持良好的计算效率。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Motivation: 解决能源网络机器学习研究中公开电力系统数据缺乏的问题

Method: 使用变分图自编码器(VGAE)，在ENGAGE和DINGO两个开源数据集上评估四种解码器变体，使用结构和谱指标比较生成网络与原始电网

Result: 简单解码器无法捕捉真实拓扑，基于GCN的方法在ENGAGE数据集上表现良好，但在更复杂的DINGO数据集上存在断开组件和重复模式等伪影

Conclusion: VGAE在电网合成方面既有前景也有局限性，需要更具表现力的生成模型和稳健的评估方法，作者开源了模型和分析以支持基准测试

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理的强化学习训练存在不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，主要原因是外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移和低概率token生成，进而引发灾难性梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，核心策略是识别并过滤掉包含无效轮次（既不生成代码块也不产生最终答案）的轨迹，从而阻止有害的高幅度梯度，稳定学习动态。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中取得最先进性能，将AIME24分数从纯文本基线的22.1提升到50.5（基于Qwen2.5-7B基础模型），并促进了多样化推理模式的发现。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR是一种即插即用的算法，有效解决了多轮工具集成推理中的训练不稳定问题，避免了监督微调的限制，使模型能够发现更复杂多样的推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.
