Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in\nrole-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive\nstrategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support\nsystems."}

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn.

We study a specific type of\nself-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a\nmodel explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have\npredicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that\nare valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no\nmore than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs\ntypically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little\ninsight into their decision-making behaviour.

To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing.

Most existing\nunsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable\ncross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these\nmethods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node\ndistinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the\nmisalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature\nheterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node\ncorrespondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that\nsimultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency\nacross latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines\nlow-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both\nstructure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space\nmisalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns\nbijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring\nconsistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive\nexperiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior\nrobustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.\nAdditionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using\ndiverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes\nbeyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language\nrepresentations."}

This shift\nto a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training\nin synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model\nperformance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the\nmodels ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and\ndetection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.\n  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data\nas a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a\nconfidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions\nduring training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross\nEntropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in\nrecursive training.\n  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to\nmodel collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and\nempirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before\ncollapse by more than 2.3x.
