Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个用于长文本生成的新框架，通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收引导优化三项核心技术，解决了效率与质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，传统方法在处理不同长度和复杂度的文本时计算效率低下。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：将计算复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在多个长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，显著提高了生成速度并保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: DrDiff框架通过三项创新技术成功解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，为高效高质量的长文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了参数高效微调(PEFT)方法在语音识别中的应用，对比了多种先进方法，并提出了结构化SVD导向微调方法，在域逆移任务中展现了更好的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但其先进变体(如VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT)主要为语言和视觉任务而开发，在语音领域缺乏充分验证。需要系统性的整合和性能评估。

Method: 在ESPnet中综合多种PEFT方法，并提出结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法。该方法选择性旋转与输入相关的右奇异向量，同时保持输出相关向量固定以维护语义映射。

Result: 在域逆移语音识别任务(包括儿童语音和方言变体)上进行了评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法展现出更强的域逆移适应能力、更少的可训练参数和更高的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究完整集成了多种PEFT方法到语音领域，并提出了高效的SSVD方法。所有实现已在ESPnet中开源，为可复现性和未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析LLaMA 3.2-3B生成葡萄牙语短篇小说中对黑人和白人女性的叙事建构，发现存在三种主要话语表征模式，揭示了看似中立的文本实则强化殖民结构下的性别不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在生成文本中如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，特别是揭示看似语法连贯、表面中立的文本背后可能存在的殖民性结构框架。

Method: 从2100篇生成文本中应用计算方法进行语义相似性分组，结合机器学习技术与人工话语分析的整合方法进行定性分析。

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现文本材料化了女性身体的固化殖民结构框架，强化了历史不平等。

Conclusion: 研究提出了结合计算方法和定性分析的综合研究框架，揭示了AI生成文本中隐含的殖民性叙事结构，对理解语言模型的社会影响具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出IDEAlgin评估框架，通过"选异"三元组任务来评估LLM生成解释性标注与专家标注的相似性，发现基于向量的方法效果不佳，而LLM作为评判者能显著提升与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地应用于开放式解释性标注任务，但缺乏可扩展的方法来评估LLM生成标注与专家标注的相似性，特别是在教育等需要专业判断的领域。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准范式，使用"选异"三元组判断任务收集专家相似性评分，并评估各种相似性度量方法（基于向量的方法和LLM作为评判者）与人类基准的一致性。

Result: 基于向量的度量方法在很大程度上无法捕捉专家认为有意义的相似性维度。通过IDEAlgin提示LLM显著提高了与专家判断的一致性（提升9-30%），优于传统的词汇和基于向量的方法。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了一个有前景的范式，有助于在教育等领域负责任地部署LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种防御性的自我迭代流程，通过多个专门的大视觉语言模型协同工作，自动生成防御性问题并迭代改进，以提升阿拉伯语长上下文问答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语长上下文问答任务的挑战，通过自动化流程减少人工干预，并支持可控制的问题难度级别。

Method: 使用三个专门模型：问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群，构建闭环迭代流程，根据质量指标自动触发重新生成和模型更新。

Result: 系统显著超越了静态流程，大幅提升了阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长上下文理解能力，并发布了AraLongBench大规模测试集。

Conclusion: 该自我迭代的防御性流程为阿拉伯语长文档处理提供了高效的自动化解决方案，具有可控制难度级别和持续改进的优势。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估基于Transformer的架构在检测在线话语中少数群体压力方面的表现，发现图结构增强的Transformer模型在检测少数群体压力方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体相比异性恋和顺性别群体经历更高比例的健康问题和精神障碍，这主要是由于少数群体压力造成的。需要开发有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力。

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型与传统机器学习基线以及图增强变体进行对比，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验。

Result: 集成图结构一致提高了Transformer模型的检测性能，有监督的微调方法优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强能够帮助模型识别关键语言标记。

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预和公共卫生政策提供了最可靠的基础。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过LoRA细调多模态大语言模型，实现了同时进行自动发音评估(APA)和错误发音检测与诊断(MDD)，无需复杂结构修改或分离训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂的网络结构修改和分离训练流程来同时处理APA和MDD任务，本研究旨在通过简化的LoRA细调方法实现集成化的发音评估系统。

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)技术进行细调，只需对LoRA层进行训练而不需全部层细调。在Speechocean762数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型在发音评估得分预测上与人工评分呈现强相关性(PCC > 0.7)，同时获得低单词误差率(WER < 0.15)和低音素误差率(PER < 0.15)。仅细调LoRA层即可达到与全部层细调相当的性能。

Conclusion: LoRA基础的方法能够通过简单的训练方法建立集成化发音评估系统，为英语L2学习者提供更可访、集成和有效的计算机辅助发音训练(CAPT)技术。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过可解释的词汇表格结构从历史审审数据中提取隐式内容审核标准，可以系统性比较不同社区的审核规范


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区如subreddits通常使用多样化且隐式的审核标准，而有效的内容审核系统需要明确的分类标准

Method: 使用可解释的架构从历史审核数据中识别和提取隐式标准，将审核标准表示为与内容删除相关联的词汇表达式的分数表

Result: 提取的词汇模式有效地复现了神经网络审核模型的性能，同时提供透明的决策见解，发现了社区特定语言宽容度、主题限制特征以及有害语言分类的潜在子类别

Conclusion: 该方法能够揭示不同社区如何实际执行表面共享的规范，发现了之前未文档化的审核模式，为内容审核系统提供了透明可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多模态QA数据集ProMQA-Assembly，包含391个问答对，用于评估装配活动中的多模态理解能力，并通过基准测试显示当前模型仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 装配任务助手在日常生活和工业场景中具有巨大潜力，但缺乏支持应用导向系统评估的测试平台，特别是在装配领域。

Method: 采用半自动化的QA标注方法，使用LLM生成候选问题并由人工验证，整合细粒度动作标签以多样化问题类型，并创建指令任务图来促进标注过程。

Result: 构建了包含391个QA对的数据集，基准测试表明包括竞争性专有多模态模型在内的当前模型仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 新的评估数据集可以促进程序性活动助手的进一步发展，为装配任务的多模态理解提供重要基准。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个基于认知行为疗法(CBT)的长周期心理咨询对话数据集DiaCBT，用于训练更专业的心理咨询模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理治疗因社会歪视和治疗师缺乏，仅能覆盖少数患者。大语言模型包含专业心理治疗技能后，可以扩大心理健康服务的可及性。但缺乏心理学对话数据集纵刻制了有效心理治疗导向对话机器人的发展。

Method: 构建了基于认知行为疗法(CBT)的长周期导向对话语料库，包含多个咨询会议，并统入认知概念化图(CCDs)以指导多样场景下的客户模拟。训练了深度咨询模型，并提出了一个综合评估框架来基于CBT咨询的已知心理学标准对其进行基准测试。

Result: 结果显示DiaCBT能有效提升大语言模型模仿具备CBT专业知识的心理学家的能力，证明其在训练更专业的咨询机器人方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建DiaCBT数据集，为培养具备CBT专业知识的心理咨询模型提供了重要支持，有助于扩大心理健康服务的可及性。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BLV损失函数来解决自动口语评估中的类别不平衡问题，通过扰动模型预测来改善少数类的特征表示，在ICNALE数据集上显著提升了分类准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动口语评估(ASA)模型在处理第二语言学习者能力评估时经常面临类别不平衡问题，导致预测结果存在偏差，需要改进模型对少数类的处理能力。

Method: 提出Balancing Logit Variation (BLV)损失函数，通过扰动模型预测来增强少数类的特征表示，无需修改原始数据集，可与BERT等文本模型集成。

Result: 在ICNALE基准数据集上的评估显示，将BLV损失集成到BERT模型中显著提高了分类准确性和公平性指标。

Conclusion: BLV损失函数有效解决了ASA模型中的类别不平衡问题，使自动语音评估对多样化学习者更加鲁棒和公平。

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在对比学习前增加双向生成重建训练阶段，通过EBQ2D和EBD2Q任务来增强LLM中[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，显著提升了文本嵌入性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法使用[EOS]等特殊标记的嵌入，但这些标记并未经过专门训练来捕获整个上下文的语义，限制了在检索和重排序任务中的表现

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务：EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档重建）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询重建），交替锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上显著提升LLM性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都达到了新的state-of-the-art结果

Conclusion: 通过增加双向生成重建训练阶段，有效增强了LLM中最终标记嵌入的语义表示能力，为文本嵌入任务提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调中的参数冗余、结构僵化和任务适应性有限的问题，提高参数利用效率和表示能力。

Method: 采用基于结构可学习机制的适配器微调方法，引入可微分门控函数和结构稀疏性控制变量，在保持主干参数冻结的同时，通过结构搜索机制动态构建任务特定的高效子结构。

Result: 在多个多任务自然语言理解任务上优于主流参数高效调优技术，在准确性、压缩率以及对噪声和扰动的鲁棒性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应结构学习显著提升了模型性能，验证了其在多任务场景下的稳定性和鲁棒性，为参数高效微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LSTM的改进RNN模型用于商业情感分析，相比传统RNN模型取得了91.33%的准确率，能够有效帮助企业分析客户反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业情感分析是自然语言处理的重要应用领域，传统RNN存在梯度消失问题，需要改进模型来提高情感分析的准确性。

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络(LSTM)替代传统循环神经网络(RNN)，解决了梯度消失问题。采用产品评论数据集，70%数据用于训练，30%用于测试。

Result: 改进的RNN模型达到了91.33%的准确率，性能优于传统RNN模型。

Conclusion: LSTM模型在商业情感分析中表现优异，可帮助企业分析客户反馈并优化营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

TL;DR: 本文评估了四种基于大语言模型(LLM)的标量结构测量方法，发现通过token概率加权的点评分方法效果最佳，微调小模型也能达到或超过提示LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言中的许多结构(如复杂性、情感性)具有连续语义特征，但LLM对数值输出的特殊处理方式需要系统评估，以确定最佳应用方法。

Method: 使用政治科学文献中的多个数据集，评估了四种方法：未加权直接点评分、成对比较聚合、token概率加权点评分和微调。

Result: 直接提示LLM生成点评分会产生不连续分布；成对比较能改善质量；token概率加权点评分效果更好；微调小模型(仅需1000个训练对)可匹配或超越提示LLM性能。

Conclusion: 为应用研究者提供了实用建议：推荐使用token概率加权点评分方法，微调小模型是经济有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过知识编辑注入指纹保护LLM知象产权，提出FSFT方法减少细调过程中的指纹退化，性能提升10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令循环注入指纹方法存在性能下降、计算费用高、持续性差等问题，需要轻量级替代方案

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用类似乱码文本的指纹防止覆盖，提出FSFT方法通过限制指纹子空间更新来减少退化

Result: FSFT方法在最坏情况下也能超过普通细调10%，但发现模型对指纹和相似文本区分困难

Conclusion: 知识编辑是轻量级指纹注入的有效方法，FSFT能显著提升指纹持续性，但需要更突破性的精细化指纹注入技术

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究通过眼动追踪和命名任务，使用广义加性模型分析爱沙尼亚语词汇处理，比较了判别式词典模型(DLM)与传统预测因子(如词频)的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究计算模型(DLM)生成的词汇处理测量是否能预测眼动和命名反应变量，并与传统预测因子进行比较，以理解词汇处理中形式和意义映射的作用。

Method: 采用大规模单被试实验，结合词汇命名任务和眼动追踪技术，使用广义加性模型分析五个反应变量(首次注视时长、总注视时长、注视次数、命名潜伏期和口语时长)。

Result: DLM测量是词汇处理的有效预测因子；深度学习DLM不一定比线性映射DLM更精确；传统预测因子通常比DLM预测更精确(总注视时长除外)；命名任务中词汇变量对首次注视时长和总注视次数无预测性。

Conclusion: DLM基于形式到意义映射的测量对总注视时长、命名潜伏期和口语时长的预测性表明，在当前词汇命名任务中意义处理起着重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five
regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our
reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++

automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要关注全球性或英语中心的内容，忽视了低资源语言和文化特定内容，自动翻译方法存在错误和文化失真问题。

Method: 创建SinhalaMMLU数据集，包含7000多个基于斯里兰卡国家课程的多选题，涵盖6个领域30个科目，包括学术和文化知识，评估26个LLM的性能。

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o分别获得67%和62%的最高准确率，但整体模型表现有限，在人文等文化丰富领域表现尤其不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在低资源语言和文化特定语境中的适应能力仍有很大改进空间，需要更多针对性的基准和优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

TL;DR: AgenTracer是一个自动化框架，通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入来标注多智能体失败轨迹，并训练出轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B，在故障归因任务上超越大型专有LLM，并能提升现有多智能体系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的多智能体系统虽然性能优越但更加脆弱，容易发生系统故障。现有的推理LLM在故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，无法有效诊断复杂多智能体交互中的错误。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架：1）通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入自动标注失败轨迹，构建TracerTraj数据集；2）使用多粒度强化学习训练轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%。对MetaGPT和MaAS等现有多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B为LLM智能体故障归因设立了新标准，能够提供可操作的反馈，赋能自校正和自进化的智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

TL;DR: LMEnt是一个用于分析语言模型预训练过程中知识获取的套件，包含知识丰富的标注语料库、高效的实体检索方法和多个预训练模型及检查点，为研究知识表示和学习动态提供控制环境。


<details>

Motivation: 当前语言模型如何将数据转化为世界知识和信念的内部过程尚不明确，需要开发工具来深入理解这些过程，以构建更一致、鲁棒和完整的知识表示。

Method: 提出LMEnt套件，包括：(1)基于Wikipedia的完全实体标注的知识丰富预训练语料库；(2)比先前方法性能提升80.4%的基于实体的检索方法；(3)12个最多10亿参数的预训练模型和4000个中间检查点。

Result: LMEnt提供了一个受控环境来分析预训练中实体提及与下游性能的关系，以及因果干预的效果。研究发现事实频率是关键因素，但不能完全解释学习趋势。

Conclusion: LMEnt支持语言模型中知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态的研究，相关资源已公开发布以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，面临的任务越来越复杂多样，可靠评估变得困难。虽然LLMs作为评估者的范式提供了可扩展的解决方案，但先前工作主要关注简单场景，在复杂任务中的可靠性仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战基准，系统性地调查和验证了6种先前未探索的偏见，涵盖12个基础场景和3个高级场景。

Result: 所有评估模型都对这些偏见表现出显著敏感性，偏见程度随任务复杂度增加而加剧；特别值得注意的是，大型推理模型表现出矛盾性的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 深入分析为改进评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和鲁棒的评估模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为沙特霸千余听力障碍人士的主要沟通方式，但现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语，缺乏专门的阿拉伯手语资源和连续语言数据集。

Method: 研究使用预训练的ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，结合Transformer Encoder和双向LSTM处理时序依赖关系，构建了一种混合深度学习模型。

Result: 模型在依赖模式下达到99.02%的高准确率，在独立模式下也获得77.71%的准确率，为SSL识别提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 这项研究为沙特手语社区提供了重要的技术资源，填补了阿拉伯手语连续语言识别的研空白，对提升听力障碍人士的沟通平等和社会融入具有重要意义。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Abstract: As AI technology advances, research in playing text-based games with agents
has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent
design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement
learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and
build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based
deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio
and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for
using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing
and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains

### [29] [Safe Sharing of Fast Kernel-Bypass I/O Among Nontrusting Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02899)
*Alan Beadle,Michael L. Scott,John Criswell*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种保护用户级库的新方法，解决了相互不信任应用程序共享内核置路服务时的安全性和性能问题，并在DDS通信服务原型中实现了更低延迟和更高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相互不信任应用程序共享内核置路服务时的安全性问题，包括时间约束、缓冲匿映攻击和异步事件处理等隐惑。

Method: 通过将无界等待移出库外、利用有界时间要求优化延迟、防止页面移除攻击、以及使用可信辅助进程处理异步事件等技术来扩展和改进保护库模型。

Result: 在DDS通信服务原型中实现了第一个成功在相互不信任应用程序间共享内核置路NIC的系统，相比商业FastDDS实现延迟降低50%，吞吐量提升8倍，CPU使用率更低。

Conclusion: 本文提供了结合内核置路和微内核优势的新操作系统服务结构方式，为保护库开发者提供了安全性和性能指南，为未来操作系统设计提供了建议。

Abstract: Protected user-level libraries have been proposed as a way to allow mutually
distrusting applications to safely share kernel-bypass services. In this paper,
we identify and solve several previously unaddressed obstacles to realizing
this design and identify several optimization opportunities. First, to preserve
the kernel's ability to reclaim failed processes, protected library functions
must complete in modest, bounded time. We show how to move unbounded waits
outside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes
without the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement
can be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process
interactions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is
vulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing
applications from removing pages that they share with the protected library.
Fourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and
dynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.
  By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a
new way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and
microkernels. We present a set of safety and performance guidelines for
developers of protected libraries, and a set of recommendations for developers
of future protected library operating systems. We demonstrate the convenience
and performance of our approach with a prototype version of the DDS
communication service. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype represents
the first successful sharing of a kernel-bypass NIC among mutually untrusting
applications. Relative to the commercial FastDDS implementation, we achieve
approximately 50\% lower latency and up to 7x throughput, with lower CPU
utilization.

### [30] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Lifecycle(LC)原则，通过状态记忆机制在神经元长期休眠后恢复其历史参数，而非随机初始化，从而解决训练不稳定问题并提升泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如Dropout只进行临时神经元失活，而长期神经元失活会导致训练不稳定，特别是当神经元重新激活时使用随机权重会破坏已学习知识

Method: LC原则核心是状态记忆机制：神经元休眠时保存其参数状态，重新激活时恢复到最后有效状态而非随机初始化，从而避免破坏性优化冲击

Result: 理论分析显示LC原则能平滑损失景观，引导优化趋向更平坦的最小值；图像分类实验证明方法能提升泛化性和鲁棒性；消融研究确认状态记忆是关键因素

Conclusion: LC原则通过状态记忆机制有效解决了长期神经元失活带来的训练不稳定问题，在保持学习知识的同时提升了模型的泛化性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决濒危野生动物非法盗猎保护的挑战，特别是在广阔且部分可观测环境中需要实时响应的场景

Method: 使用EM算法建模隐藏环境因素和智能体间动态的隐变量，增强不确定条件下的探索和协同能力，构建EM-MARL框架

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

*Hunter Gittlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 群体感知阈值校准方法通过为不同人口群体设置不同决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题上比传统合成数据生成方法更有效，能提高平衡准确率和最差群体表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，传统解决方案往往会产生新问题。研究发现需要更稳健的方法来处理不同人口群体的性能差异。

Method: 提出群体感知阈值校准方法，为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，而不是对所有群体使用单一阈值。该方法优化平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 群体特定阈值比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型提高1.5-4%的平衡准确率，同时改善最差群体平衡准确率。在七个模型家族（线性、树基、实例基和提升方法）上都得到验证。

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准提供了更简单、更可解释且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，相比合成数据生成方法具有显著优势，且两者结合使用收益有限。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO算法，一种基于直接偏好优化的鲁棒微调方法，用于公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题中的奖励函数设计，能够有效处理偏好信号中的噪声并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题具有复杂模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，需要设计能够处理人类自然语言偏好表达中不确定性的鲁棒奖励函数。

Method: 基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，采用轻量级的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来考虑偏好分布的不确定性，相比之前的DRO-based DPO方法更加不保守。

Result: 在ARMMAN组织的真实世界孕产妇移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现出更好的鲁棒性，同时与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中处理偏好不确定性，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

*Zhongzhu Zhou,Yibo Yang,Ziyan Chen,Fengxiang Bie,Haojun Xia,Xiaoxia Wu,Robert Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Bernard Ghanem,Shuaiwen Leon Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，通过在策略梯度方法中固定动作选择层为等角紧框架(ETF)结构，加速和稳定强化学习训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在最优策略DNN训练中会出现类似神经坍缩的Action Collapse现象，即相同最优动作的状态-动作激活会坍缩到其均值，变异性趋于零，动作选择层权重和均值激活坍缩到ETF结构。

Method: 提出ACPG方法，将合成ETF固定为动作选择层，引导策略DNN产生理想的ETF配置，同时保持最优性。该方法可集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中。

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中的实验表明，ACPG能够更快、更稳定地获得更好的奖励改进。

Conclusion: 使用固定ETF作为动作选择层目标配置可以自然导致Action Collapse，ACPG方法有效提升了策略梯度方法的训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用Mamba选择性状态空间模型作为基础模型，通过自监督重建任务和癫痫检测任务训练，在EEG数据分析中取得0.72 AUROC性能，为临床EEG分析提供新途径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有噪声大、高维、非线性的特点，传统机器学习方法难以捕捉其复杂的时空动态特性，需要更强大的序列建模方法来提升神经疾病诊断的准确性

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，在大规模癫痫和非癫痫EEG数据集上进行训练，首先进行自监督重建任务，然后进行癫痫检测任务

Result: 在测试集上达到0.72的AUROC性能，证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发大规模、临床适用的EEG数据分析基础模型迈出了重要一步，展示了基础模型在EEG分析中的潜力

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QPQuant是一个动态量化框架，通过概率采样和损失感知层优先级选择，解决了DP-SGD中量化导致精度显著下降的问题，在保持差分隐私的同时实现了接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现量化在差分隐私SGD中会导致比常规SGD更严重的精度下降，原因是噪声注入放大了量化方差。需要开发新方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）每轮epoch概率采样选择要量化的层子集；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先级选择，识别对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，实现接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化方差放大的问题，通过动态层选择策略在保持差分隐私保证的同时显著提升了量化训练的效率和质量。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LExI是一种数据无关的优化技术，通过自适应调整每层激活专家数量来提升MoE模型的推理效率，相比传统剪枝方法在保持精度的同时显著提升推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型通常在所有层激活固定数量的专家，导致冗余计算和次优性能。传统剪枝方法主要减少内存使用，但对GPU推理效率提升有限

Method: LExI利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，无需数据即可自适应确定每层最优激活专家数量

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，推理效率大幅提升且精度损失可忽略。例如Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上达到相同吞吐量时精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI通过层间专家数量自适应分配，有效解决了MoE模型推理效率问题，为稀疏架构优化提供了新方向

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决从不同观测类型（如应力角、地幔温度、板块类型等）的异构数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够处理多模态、可扩展的模型架构。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持任意数量的模态输入，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在验证数据上，应力角预测误差降低了三倍以上，模型性能随参数增加而提升，展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下的基础模型，具有处理多模态数据、支持上下文学习和良好可扩展性的特点，为全球任何地方的地下属性预测提供了初步基础。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

TL;DR: 提出结构化基函数网络，通过Bregman散度统一多假设预测和集成学习，解决现有方法在多样性聚合和结构化模糊性捕获方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测不确定性方法存在局限：多假设预测缺乏理论聚合，集成学习难以捕获结构化模糊性，缺乏与损失几何一致的统一框架。

Method: 使用Bregman散度诱导的质心聚合连接多假设预测和集成学习，支持闭式最小二乘估计器和基于梯度的通用目标优化，提供可调多样性机制控制偏差-方差-多样性权衡。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多假设泛化与损失感知集成聚合之间的关系，并在深度学习预测器上研究了复杂度-容量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一个统一的框架，能够同时处理回归和分类问题，通过损失几何对齐预测，有效解决了预测不确定性的结构化建模问题。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)在增加网络深度时容易出现过平滑问题，难以有效捕获全局和区域图结构信息。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码了全局信息，通过预训练GNN预测这些特征向量，可以促使网络自然学习大规模结构模式。

Method: 提出自监督预训练框架，通过归纳学习图拉普拉斯特征向量来预训练GNN。该方法基于图结构，具有高度灵活性，可应用于所有基于图的数据集，在任务特定数据稀疏时还可使用合成特征。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的结构导向的GNN预训练方法，能够克服传统MPNN的局限性，提升对全局图结构的学习能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中比竞争方法获得更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如之前认为的好。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种更有效的LLM遗忘方法，配合改进的评估框架能够更准确地评估遗忘方法的真实效果，为模型安全提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Conclusion: 结果证实集成堆叠方法具有更强的预测能力，尤其适用于复杂的数据分布情况。混合多数投票方法作为一种稳健的备选方案，在医疗健康应用中为预测模型选择提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该TTC框架为偏微方程建模提供了更高级的推理算法基础，包括基于强化学习的方法，有望转变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: SBICE框架为因果评估提供了更可靠的方法，通过处理参数不确定性生成更真实的合成数据集，改善了因果估计器的比较和基准测试。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一个简单高效的后处理不确定性量化框架，能够在不影响已训练模型的情况下进行不确定性估计。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Conclusion: Vendi Score指标和VendiRL框架为解决强化学习中技能多样性评估和学习的一致性问题提供了有效工具，支持在各种交互环境中优化不同形式的多样性。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功解决了传统神经网络在非周期信号分析中的局限性，通过结合KAN的非线性处理能力和AR组件的记忆机制，为复杂信号分析提供了有效的解决方案，在大多数实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原则：服务器聚合来自非参与客户端的最新接收梯度，同时结合活跃客户端的实时动量。开发了D-Byz-SGDM优化器来实现这一原则

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法有效解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题，提供了理论保证和实际验证，为稀疏通信场景下的安全联邦学习提供了解决方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新权重矩阵，在大语言模型训练中表现优异，但缺乏确定学习率的方法。而AdaGrad作为广泛使用的自适应方法，通过累积历史梯度信息来缩放梯度。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向相结合。保持更新方向的正交性（可解释为谱下降方向），同时通过累积梯度范数缩放方向来适应优化景观。实现上只需在Muon基础上增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛速率。在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上的实证结果表明，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功结合了正交化更新和自适应步长调整的优势，计算和内存效率高，理论保证充分，实验性能优异，为优化算法设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

TL;DR: 提出一种流式、无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化和安全机制，用于睡眠分期模型在未见过的生理或记录条件下的自适应部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在部署到具有未见生理特征或记录条件的患者时性能会下降，需要一种无需源数据或患者校准的实用自适应方法。

Method: 结合熵最小化(Tent)、批归一化统计刷新，以及两个安全机制：熵门控(在不确定窗口暂停自适应)和EMA重置(防止漂移)的流式测试时自适应方法。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

TL;DR: 多模态数据融合方法，结合高价值X射线数据和低成本吸收率数据，通过深度学习领域过渡学习技术提升炼池动力学预测准确性，最终只需低成本传感器即可实现高精度监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测技术存在限制：高速X射线成本高且实用性低，而低成本光电二极管数据噪声大且单独使用预测准确性低。需要一种方法能够结合两者优势，实现高效率、低成本的实时监测。

Method: 提出多模态数据融合方法：结合CNN网络处理X射线空间特征，RNN网络处理吸收率时间序列特征，采用早期融合策略。然后使用多模态模型作为过渡学习模型，微调RNN模型，使其仅依靠吸收率数据即可预测炼池动力学。

Result: 多模态训练显著提升了预测准确性，远超单独使用任一模态。训练完成后，模型仅需吸收率数据即可推断炼池特征，无需昂贵的X射线成像。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合方法能够实现成本效益高的实时监测，在增材制造领域具有广泛的应用前景，为工业环境下的过程监控提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的物理知识指导符号回归方法需要专业的形式化和手动特征工程，限制了其适用性。本文利用预训练的大语言模型来自动化域知识的整合，以降低手动干预的需求。

Method: 将LLM整合到符号回归的损失函数中，添加一个来自LLM对生成方程评估的项。使用三种SR算法（DEAP、gplearn、PySR）和三种预训练LLM（Falcon、Mistral、LLama 2），在三种物理动力学问题上进行评估。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了利用预训练LLM来自动整合域知识的可行性，为更广泛的科学问题提供了更可访的符号回归方法。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大语言模型二值量化的新优化目标和三种算法，通过自适应分组策略动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵，在保持1.007位平均位长的同时实现接近原始模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二值量化能显著减少存储和推理成本，但传统二值量化方法相比4位量化存在明显性能下降问题。

Method: 提出专门针对二值量化的优化目标，设计三种算法实现该目标，通过自适应分组策略增强分块量化，动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵。

Result: 量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型困惑度达到8.23（原模型7.81），显著优于之前SOTA BiLLM的123.90，与SOTA 4位方法GPTQ在性能和效率上相当，量化过程高效（单CPU核心14秒完成权重量化）。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低平均位长（1.007位）下实现了接近原始模型的性能，证明了二值量化在大语言模型压缩中的有效性，为高效模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现通用智能需要基于语言、物理世界和结构化数据的互补基础模型。本文旨在开发首个大型结构化数据模型，统一处理各种表格任务。

Method: 使用掩码联合分布建模进行预训练，采用情景化、上下文条件目标，模型基于数据集特定上下文预测查询子集，支持推理时的快速、免训练适应。

Conclusion: LimiX展示了结构化数据基础模型的强大能力，通过单一统一接口处理多种表格任务，避免了任务特定架构或定制训练，所有模型已开源。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Motivation: 提供统一的框架来通过离散功能几何视角分析ReLU网络，为理解、诊断和改善泛化性能提供新工具。

Method: 将RTG框架扩展为图论模型，其中节点表示线性激活区域，边链接相差仅一个ReLU激活翻转的区域。证明了随机初始化时RTG的扩展性、度分布和谱性质。通过区域熵和、谱间隔和KL散度提出新的容量和泛化界。

Result: 实验结果显示：区域熵在过参数化时饱和，谱间隔与泛化性相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映了功能平滑性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过离散几何框架为分析ReLU网络提供了统一的视角，为理解和改善泛化性能提供了新的理论基础和工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制存在两种策略：相位选择策略可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响安全性，而切换策略可能导致不公平和低效的相位分配。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Method: 提出Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP)模型，采用分层控制：高层代理根据整体交通状态分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理在每个主要方向内进一步分配直行和左转运动的时间。

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络以及多种交通流数据集上进行测试，结果显示DHCP模型在所有数据集上都优于基线方法，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层时间分配机制，在保持相位序列可预测性的同时实现了更灵活和高效的交通信号控制，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法具有强大的普适性、实时处理能力和工程可行性，尤其适用于标准物质缺乏或需要快速现场分析的场合

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)对于模型验证和信任至关重要，但Rashomon效应（多个同等准确模型对同一预测给出不同解释）挑战了XAI的可靠性。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类Rashomon集合模型：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的图神经网络(GNNs)，通过特征归因方法测量模型内部和模型间的解释一致性。

Result: 研究发现存在显著的解释不一致性，不同模型对同一预测的解释差异很大。

Conclusion: 解释歧义性是自动驾驶动作预测问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模伪影，这对安全关键应用中XAI的可靠性提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单阈值二值化会导致方法排名逆转和结论不可靠，需要开发更稳健的评估框架。

Method: 提出阈值无关框架，计算交并比曲线下面积(AUC-IoU)，在完整阈值范围内评估归因质量，避免了单一阈值选择带来的偏差。

Result: 在皮肤镜图像上评估7种归因方法，显示单阈值指标产生矛盾结果，而无阈值评估提供可靠区分。XRAI比LIME提升31%，比原始积分梯度提升204%，不同病灶尺寸的性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 该无阈值框架建立了消除评估伪影的方法学标准，为医学影像及其他领域的归因方法选择提供了理论洞见和实用指导。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Conclusion: 论文填补了公平性决策树设计空间的研究空白，对之前很少被研究的约束方案和双树方案进行了实验性探索和特征化分析。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Conclusion: 通过从成功和失败两方面学习，提出的方法有效解决了自我模仿学习的根本问题，为稀疏奖励环境下的强化学习提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了窗口化F1指标(F1_w)来解决时间序列事件检测评估中的问题，特别是在地面真值为单点标注但实际现象是渐变的情况下，传统指标如F1和点调整F1会误导模型性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可穿戴设备压力监测等应用中，地面真值通常标注为单点事件，但实际生理现象是渐变和时域扩散的。传统评估指标在这种现实世界的不平衡数据集中往往错误表示模型性能。

Method: 引入基于窗口的F1指标(F1_w)，该指标包含时间容差，能够在精确对齐不现实的情况下提供更稳健的事件检测评估。在三个生理数据集(两个野外数据集ADARP、Wrist Angel和一个实验数据集ROAD)上进行实证分析。

Result: F1_w能够揭示传统指标无法发现的模型性能模式，其窗口大小可根据领域知识调整以避免高估。使用TimesFM预测时，只有时间容差指标能够显示在野外用例中相对于随机和零基线的统计显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作解决了时间序列评估中的关键差距，为医疗保健应用提供了实用指导，其中时间精度要求因上下文而异。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高秩表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法参数效率高但表达能力有限

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA在性能上匹配甚至超越高秩适配器，同时所需的可训练参数数量与向量化方法相当

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新和参数效率的平衡，理论分析和消融研究验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: FoMEMO为昂贵多目标优化提供了新的范式，通过大规模合成数据预训练的基础模型实现了对未知问题的快速适应和优异性能。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Conclusion: TopoMap能够有效创建DL模型输入特征空间的拓扑地图，为系统测试提供有意义的故障区域分组

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表位是免疫治疗和疫苗开发的关键，但合成表位库的设计面临组合爆炸问题，传统筛选方法不可行，需要新的生成方法

Method: 开发epiGPTope语言模型，在蛋白质数据上预训练，在线性表位上微调，直接生成表位样序列；训练统计分类器预测表位来源

Conclusion: 生成模型与预测模型结合的方法可辅助表位发现，仅需氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征，有望加速新生物技术开发

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中的缺失数据问题对模型性能和可靠性造成重大挑战，特别是在生物信息学和临床机器学习领域。虽然存在多种插补方法，但没有一种方法能够在所有数据集和缺失机制下都表现稳定。

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中，结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择策略，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和具有较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提升最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF方法有效解决了过程奖励和结果奖励之间的权衡问题，为数学推理任务提供了更优的训练策略

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定时间交通信号控制依赖手工公式和人工调整，成本高且效果不佳，特别是在异构或拥堵条件下需要更智能的自动化算法设计方法。

Method: 将问题表述为程序合成，候选算法表示为具有固定输入输出结构的Python函数，通过外部评估（交通模拟器）和进化搜索进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明发现的算法优于Webster基线，平均延迟减少20.1%，平均停车次数减少47.1%，并提供对交通工程师有实际意义的改进见解。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计的新研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中缺失模态和有限标签数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 采用软正未标记(PU)对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，结合潜在重构损失保留模态特异性信息，模块化设计增强对不完整模态的韧性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景下均优于现有方法，性能表现优异。

Conclusion: Robult框架具有轻量级设计和良好可扩展性，能够无缝集成到现有架构中，适合实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

TL;DR: AEnt是一种针对LLM-RL训练的新型熵控制方法，通过钳位熵奖励和自动调整系数来解决传统熵正则化在大语言模型强化学习中的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳位熵奖励（在较小token空间上重新归一化策略计算）和自动调整的熵系数，鼓励在紧凑响应集内探索。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集上均优于基线方法，在多个基准测试中表现一致优秀。

Conclusion: AEnt通过改进熵控制机制，有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的探索问题，为大规模语言模型的强化学习提供了更有效的熵管理方案。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 探索夏令时实施对不同地理位置国家睡眠时长的影响

Method: 采用61国家睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按DST实施情况分组，通过可视化比较睡眠模式

Result: DST国家平均睡眠时长更长，但维度不同影响异空：低维度区域DST国家睡眠更短，高维度区域DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: DST对睡眠的影响受地理位置调节，维度是关键变量

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中由于内存和通信限制而被排除在训练之外的边缘设备问题，这些设备的排除会导致数据不可访问和系统偏差增加。

Method: 基于MeZO零阶方法，设计ZOWarmUp算法，利用不同客户端能力和方差减少技术，使低资源客户端能够参与训练，仅需传输少量随机种子而非完整梯度。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp算法为原本会被排除训练的高比例边缘设备提供了参与机会，从而获得更多样化的数据，改善了训练结果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Conclusion: 本文为多假设情况下的似然函数校准提供了理论框架，扩展了传统的二元校准理论，在保持贝叶斯规则可加性的同时提高了统计推断的可靠性。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化潜在聚类结构数据时，虽然能很好地分离聚类并保持局部信息，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用模块化方法：首先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个聚类，最后对齐所有聚类以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，同时具有更高的透明度

Conclusion: 提出的模块化降维方法在保持竞争力的同时，提供了更好的透明度和全局几何结构保持能力

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然在不同任务中表现出色，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方法（基于LeCun和Glorot原则）和一个可调指数的经验性幂律初始化家族，通过大规模网格搜索、函数拟合、PDE基准测试和Neural Tangent Kernel分析进行评估。

Conclusion: 本文为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，特别是幂律初始化方法在各种场景下都表现出色，有助于提升KANs的训练效果和性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

### [96] [LINKER: Learning Interactions Between Functional Groups and Residues With Chemical Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning and Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03425)
*Phuc Pham,Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法的局限性：依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性

Method: 采用结构监督的注意力机制，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物中推导相互作用标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能够产生与真实生化注释高度一致的相互作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可进行大规模应用，特别适用于结构数据不可用的情况，为分子识别和理性药物设计提供了新工具

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

*Niteesh Midlagajni,Constantin A. Rothkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于GNN的框架，用于学习液体在刚体交互和主动操控下的动力学，能够处理复杂几何表面的粒子碰撞，并泛化到未见过的物体和操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法主要局限于静态自由落体环境或简单操作设置，忽略了与动态运动刚体的复杂交互，需要开发能够处理复杂液体-刚体交互的模拟方法。

Method: 使用图神经网络(GNN)框架，将粒子表示为图节点，采用边界体积层次(BVH)算法处理粒子-物体碰撞，利用表面表示来建模复杂几何形状的交互。

Result: 模型能够准确捕捉动态环境中的流体行为，在单一倾倒任务上训练后，能够有效泛化到未见物体和新颖操作任务（如搅拌和舀取），并可用于基于梯度的控制和优化任务。

Conclusion: 该GNN框架成功解决了液体与复杂几何形状刚体之间的动态交互问题，展示了在多种操作任务中的良好泛化能力，为液体操控和控制任务提供了有效的模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法中参数子空间在非奇异控制下形成有限余维Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为TwF在顺序训练中精确保持映射提供了理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持先前学习样本的端点映射，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义下的保持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF的参数子空间构成有限余维Banach子流形，并详细刻画该子流形的切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF方法对应的参数子空间确实形成Banach子流形，其切空间特征表明TwF相当于沿着该子流形切空间的连续变形，能够精确保持映射关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明该方法能够在顺序训练过程中精确保持先前学习到的映射关系，超越了之前的一阶近似理解。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究构建了全球作物类型数据集CropGlobe，开发了轻量级CNN模型CropNet，并通过时间数据增强技术提升跨区域作物分类的泛化能力，发现Sentinel-2的2D中值时间特征具有最强的地理不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球尺度的作物类型精确识别对粮食安全至关重要，但遥感分类在跨地理区域应用时因地面样本有限和地理偏移导致性能下降，需要寻找对地理变化不变的特征表示。

Method: 构建包含30万个像素样本的全球作物数据集CropGlobe；比较时序多光谱特征和高光谱特征的迁移性；设计轻量CNN模型CropNet；采用时间偏移、时间尺度和幅度扭曲等数据增强技术模拟跨区域物候变化。

Result: Sentinel-2的2D中值时间特征在所有迁移场景中表现出最强的地理不变性；数据增强技术进一步提高了模型鲁棒性，特别是在训练数据多样性有限时效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究发现了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理可迁移性，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了大语言模型的欺骗行为，通过机制可解释性技术揭示了欺骗的神经机制，并开发了行为导向向量来精细操控欺骗倾向，发现了欺骗与任务性能之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中自主性增强，其可信度问题引起关注。虽然幻觉问题已被广泛研究，但模型故意说谎以实现隐藏目标的现象仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术，包括logit lens分析、因果干预和对比激活导向，来识别和控制欺骗行为。研究真实世界的说谎场景，并引入行为导向向量来精细操控说谎倾向。

Result: 揭示了欺骗的神经机制，建立了欺骗与最终任务性能之间的帕累托前沿，发现不诚实行为在某些情况下可以增强目标优化。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI伦理讨论做出了贡献，揭示了在高风险环境中部署大语言模型的风险和潜在保障措施，为理解和控制模型的欺骗行为提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

TL;DR: 媒体监督可以作为AI安全的软监管机制，通过声誉机制促使AI开发者选择安全而非利润，但需要信息可靠性和成本可控才能有效促进合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI开发者往往在利润与用户安全之间选择利润，需要建立有效的监督机制来确保AI技术的安全性和可信度。

Method: 使用进化博弈论创建自利的AI创造者和用户的人工群体，研究媒体报道对促进合作的影响。

Result: 媒体确实能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但前提是媒体信息质量可靠，且获取媒体信息或确保安全的成本不能过高。

Conclusion: 媒体通过塑造公众认知和追究开发者责任，成为一种强大的软监管力量，即使在缺乏正式政府监管的情况下也能引导AI安全发展。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains

summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在语义和时间抽象方面的理解和推理能力不足，需要开发能够理解自然视频中动作语义的模型

Method: 使用LLM自优化提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，通过双系统规划（反应式系统1和反思式系统2）进行成本最小化规划

Result: 在VPA基准测试和PlannerArena人类评估中达到最先进性能，系统2比系统1Elo得分提升27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线

Conclusion: VLWM通过语言建模和双系统规划方法，有效提升了世界模型的语义理解和规划能力，为视觉规划任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Conclusion: 通过结合语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，可以构建更高效的AI驱动数据分析系统，为该领域的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Motivation: LLM生成的任务计划和人类演示可能包含噪声动作、冗余导航和逻辑错误，这会降低策略质量，需要一种方法来清理和优化这些计划。

Method: 使用迭代验证框架：Judge LLM批评动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，通过自然语言提示实现广泛泛化，处理不相关动作、矛盾和缺失步骤等错误类型。

Conclusion: 该方法将计划验证确立为LLM在空间规划和动作优化中的可靠能力，为具身AI中的模仿学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Method: 系统分析基于解接受、低层启发式重复和扰动强度三个关键原则的变换策略，并在简单的无偏随机选择机制上验证这些变换的原始效果。

Result: 通过适当构建的变换策略，简单方法在三个具有挑战性的现实领域超越了所有现有最先进超启发式，发现了11个新的最优解，并与CHeSC竞赛获胜者相当。

Conclusion: 策略变换方法不仅简化了现有超启发式设计，还在CHeSC基准测试和现实领域上超越了当前最先进方法，证明了变换策略在提升超启发式性能方面的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在需要学习长而复杂行动序列的领域中，如何确定在适应性探索方法中切换探索与利用阶段的关键问题

Method: 提出通用性适应探索框架，使用不确定性来以厘学方式处理切换问题，可结合内在动机或认知不确定性等任意不确定性测量机制

Conclusion: 通用性适应探索框架提供了一种厘学方式来解决探索-利用切换问题，具有强大的灵活性和扩展性，能够融合多种不确定性测量方法

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InAbHyD数据集来评估大语言模型在归纳和溯因推理方面的能力，发现LLMs在简单场景中能进行此类推理，但在复杂世界模型中难以产生高质量假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但较少被探索，需要系统评估LLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建可编程的合成数据集InAbHyD，每个推理示例包含不完整的世界模型和观察结果，要求智能体产生解释观察的假设，并基于奥卡姆剃刀原理提出新的评估指标。

Result: 评估分析显示，最先进的LLMs能在简单场景中进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术也难以产生高质量假设。

Conclusion: LLMs在归纳和溯因推理方面仍有局限，特别是在处理复杂世界模型和产生高质量假设方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Motivation: 当前自主AI代理多为自动化聊天机器人，通常由不可靠的指挥者控制，导致信息泄漏问题较为严重。

Method: 提出基于环境变化触发行为的底层框架，引入异构环境感知（aspects）概念，使不同代理组以不同方式感知环境，实现信息控制。提供了示例实现。

Result: 与泄漏率达83%的典型架构相比，aspective agentic AI框架实现了零信息泄漏。

Conclusion: 专业化代理在自身信息小生境中高效工作的概念，能够同时提升安全性和效率。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了具身AI系统的对抗性安全攻击，基于ISO标准提出了安全违规分类法，创建了ANNIEBench基准测试和ANNIE-Attack攻击框架，在代表性EAI模型上攻击成功率超过50%，揭示了具身AI系统中被忽视但后果严重的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言-动作模型在具身AI机器人中的集成，系统面临新的安全风险：受损的VLA模型可以将感官输入的对抗性扰动直接转化为不安全的物理动作。传统机器学习安全方法已不足够，需要研究在物理接地、交互环境中如何定义、测量安全以及设计有效的攻防机制。

Method: 基于ISO人机交互标准：(1)形式化了基于物理约束（分离距离、速度、碰撞边界）的安全违规分类法（关键、危险、风险）；(2)创建了ANNIEBench基准，包含9个安全关键场景和2400个视频-动作序列；(3)开发了ANNIE-Attack任务感知对抗框架，使用攻击引导模型将长时程目标分解为帧级扰动。

Conclusion: 研究结果暴露了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但后果严重的攻击面，强调了在物理AI时代迫切需要安全驱动的防御措施。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化方法实现连续、物理合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数而非原始坐标，对于车道保持预测离散坐标，对于车道变换生成增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)的参数。

Result: 输出大小比基于坐标的方法减少80%，整体意图预测准确率达到98.73%的先进水平，同时保持与传统LLM预测器相当的性能。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在保持高性能的同时，显著提高了可解释性和资源效率，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 经济税收方法是一种有效的绿色云计算促进手段，能够引导工作负载从低效数据中心向高效数据中心转移，实现整体能耗降低。

Abstract: The cloud computing technology uses datacenters, which require energy. Recent
trends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,
or at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed
different algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy
efficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term
Green Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for
reducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called
GreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering
datacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running
energy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,
which consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient
datacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was
implemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data
sets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,
which we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax.

Motivation: LLM训练中的可靠性问题导致资源浪费和性能下降，但现有的集体通信库作为黑盒运行，缺乏有效的根因分析所需的关键信息。

Method: Mycroft通过追踪集体通信状态，利用内部控制和数据依赖关系来解决可靠性问题，是一个轻量级的分布式追踪系统。

Result: 在字节跳动部署6个月以上，90%的情况下15秒内检测到异常，60%的情况下20秒内识别出根因。故障注入实验验证了其能力和效率。

Conclusion: Mycroft有效解决了LLM训练中集体通信的可靠性问题，提供了快速的问题检测和根因分析能力。

Abstract: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However,
many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in
wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's
collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical
information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a
lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to
address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.
Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage
internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM
training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug
collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies
within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20
seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection
experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various
fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at
unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and
sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in
maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern
is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and
software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a
fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)
Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous
training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and
software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)
Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for
normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group
reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains
nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery
within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,
completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and
their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery
to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration
LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can
achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150
seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly
consistent for different scales of training tasks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无服务器计算控制平面设计的性能-成本权衡，通过开源系统模拟商业平台行为，发现实例周转导致10-40%的CPU开销和2-10倍的内存浪费，并指出当前系统在减少开销时会导致性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算正在改变云应用开发，但控制平面设计的性能-成本权衡由于缺乏跨平台基准测试和详细系统分析而未被充分理解。

Method: 设计近似商业提供商（如AWS Lambda和Google Cloud Run）扩展行为的无服务器系统，通过重放真实工作负载和调整自动扩展参数，系统比较同步和异步自动扩展策略的性能和成本效率。

Result: 发现无服务器系统因实例周转产生显著计算开销（相当于请求处理CPU周期的10-40%），由于扩展策略导致高内存分配（比实际使用多2-10倍），且减少这些开销通常会导致当前系统性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要新的成本效益高的自动扩展策略，并采用结合真实控制平面部署和大规模模拟的混合方法，弥合研究集群与真实环境之间的差距。

Abstract: Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the
performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood
due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses.
In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that
approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and
cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by
replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters.
  We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the
operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and
transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect
latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First,
we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due
to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request
handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high
memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.
Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in
significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the
need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a
hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with
large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale,
thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world
environments.

Conclusion: 该协议通过PVSS与预提交的集成，在保持完整性的同时提升了效率和安全性，在中等参与波动场景下保持低延迟和高稳定性

Abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols for dynamically available
systems face a critical challenge: balancing latency and security in
fluctuating node participation. Existing solutions often require multiple
rounds of voting per decision, leading to high latency or limited resilience to
adversarial behavior. This paper presents a BFT protocol integrating a
pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) into
message transmission. By binding users' identities to their messages through
PVSS, our approach reduces communication rounds. Compared to other
state-of-the-art methods, our protocol typically requires only four network
delays (4$\Delta$) in common scenarios while being resilient to up to 1/2
adversarial participants. This integration enhances the efficiency and security
of the protocol without compromising integrity. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates the robustness of the protocol against Byzantine attacks.
Experimental evaluations show that, compared to traditional BFT protocols, our
protocol significantly prevents fork occurrences and improves chain stability.
Furthermore, compared to longest-chain protocol, our protocol maintains
stability and lower latency in scenarios with moderate participation
fluctuations.

Motivation: 多租户云环境中虚拟机共享物理资源导致性能干扰问题，现有管理技术需要准确的性能预测，但在公有云黑盒环境下面临挑战。

Method: 提出CloudFormer双分支Transformer模型，联合建模时间动态和系统级交互，利用206个系统指标以1秒分辨率进行分析，无需场景特定调优。

Conclusion: CloudFormer能够有效捕获瞬时干扰效应并适应变化的工作负载条件，在未知工作负载上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse,
resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and
cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are
consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While
virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,
it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such
as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to
severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM
scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction
to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds
due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.
To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch
Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in
black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and
system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second
resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the
model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload
conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we
provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal
resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization
across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a
mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement
in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.
