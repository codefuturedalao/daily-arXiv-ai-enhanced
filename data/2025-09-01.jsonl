The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW.

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces.

The scores of\neach individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with\nmembership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In\na proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom\nrepresentations that correlated modestly but significantly with established\nscales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting\nconvergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to\nformalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,\noperationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing\nmeasurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI\nsystems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,\nmiddle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment."}

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple\nprompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent\nunderlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of \"ideological depth\"\nin LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political\nrepresentations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower\nsteerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our\nevaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than\nanother model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core\npolitical feature in an ideologically \"deep\" model, leading to consistent,\nlogical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same\nintervention in a \"shallow\" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.\nOur findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs\nand that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political\narchitecture."}

This is a preprint of an article submitted to IEEE\n  Transactions on Information Theory", "summary": "In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been\nan increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean\nspace. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,\nand they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical\nstructures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret\nminimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have\nbeen developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on\nthe choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to\nRiemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the\ngeometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML\n(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and\ncoincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in\nEuclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the\nsetting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify\nthe computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data\nspaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the\npractical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML\nfor normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces."}

From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context\nand temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside\nthe simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the\ncommon ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The\nanalysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an\nexact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus\nsampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees.

To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding\nGenerative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired\nby the biological wake-sleep cycle.

This approach obviates the need to store any raw\ndata, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant\nadvantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer\nvision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)\nbenchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline.

Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge.

One\nkey insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that\nwide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)\npromote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in\ninput data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD\nconsistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our \\method consistently enhances the quality of\nseed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on\naverage while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a\nnew paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution\nof data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon."}

Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied\nto mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly\neffective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,\ntheir performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent\nclassifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,\nespecially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we\npropose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes\ndiversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise\ndiversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize\nthem into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then\nexplores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,\neach representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is\nidentified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection\nprocess incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's\nperformance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct\nexperiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from\ndifferent application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method\nis compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results\nshow that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.\nThe implementation details are available on the project's repository:\nhttps://github.com/SaraBCoutinho/HSFN ."}

Managing such massive data streams presents significant\nchallenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively\nexpensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data\nreduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making\nthem unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these\nchallenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized\nframework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to\ndynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing\nflexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability\nand accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines\nthe process of converting Python-based neural network models into\nSNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark\ncomparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple\nneural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis\nconfigurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA.

Effectively\nleveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as\nreal-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing\napproaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection\nstrategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where\ndata availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework\ndesigned for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health\narchitecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing\nmodalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging\nspecialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach\ndynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data\nmodalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability\nscenarios.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal\nfusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality\navailability patterns.
