In this paper,\nwe identify and solve several previously unaddressed obstacles to realizing\nthis design and identify several optimization opportunities. First, to preserve\nthe kernel's ability to reclaim failed processes, protected library functions\nmust complete in modest, bounded time. We show how to move unbounded waits\noutside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes\nwithout the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement\ncan be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process\ninteractions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is\nvulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing\napplications from removing pages that they share with the protected library.\nFourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and\ndynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.\n  By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a\nnew way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and\nmicrokernels. We present a set of safety and performance guidelines for\ndevelopers of protected libraries, and a set of recommendations for developers\nof future protected library operating systems. We demonstrate the convenience\nand performance of our approach with a prototype version of the DDS\ncommunication service. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype represents\nthe first successful sharing of a kernel-bypass NIC among mutually untrusting\napplications. Relative to the commercial FastDDS implementation, we achieve\napproximately 50\\% lower latency and up to 7x throughput, with lower CPU\nutilization."}

In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for\nreducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called\nGreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering\ndatacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running\nenergy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,\nwhich consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient\ndatacenters to energy-efficient datacenters.

A major concern\nis the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and\nsoftware failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a\nfast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)\nActive and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous\ntraining state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and\nsoftware failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)\nScale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for\nnormal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group\nreconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains\nnearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery\nwithin one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,\ncompletely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and\ntheir associated overhead.

Therefore, accountability\nbecomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory\nbodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and\nfocus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a\nknowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term\naccountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on\nthe actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI\naccountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges\nthe gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for\nAI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of\naccountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a\nthree-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our\naccountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and\nthe mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.\nMoreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI\nsystem to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our\nframework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared\ndependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should\nfoster collaborations.

Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures\nare powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using\ndeep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing\nthan DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend\nto provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except\nfor total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),\nand fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for\nfirst fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works\nwith mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for\ntotal fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates\nthat meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task."}

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix.

We provide an illustrative implementation and show that\ncompared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,\naspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this\nconcept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information\nniches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency."}

A growing body of work illustrates the promise of\nintegrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's\ngenerality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by\nincorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized\nformulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only\nto domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the\ncontextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim\nto automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual\nintervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of\nscientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,\nadding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation.

A major concern\nis the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and\nsoftware failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a\nfast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)\nActive and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous\ntraining state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and\nsoftware failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)\nScale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for\nnormal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group\nreconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains\nnearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery\nwithin one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,\ncompletely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and\ntheir associated overhead.

If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive\nattribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as\nfollows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function\nthat is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on\nthe weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)\nThe second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function\nin y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the\nobjective, but part of a constraint.

This has been\ndiscussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be\nwritten as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs\nand its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the\nidempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the\nLLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been\nlimited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two\nhypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to\nrecover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending\ntherefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.\nEspecially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the\nconstraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple\nhypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio\ntransformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still\nprovide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear\ndiscriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated\nlikelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability\nand the reliability of the method."}

We present here a\nsummary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer\n2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming\nincreasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link\nbetween AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully\nleverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes\nopportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from\nfundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic\npriorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an\ninterdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and\nworkforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with\na summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational\ninstitutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to\nbe a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of\nAI+MPS."}

However, even when optimized, these operators can be\nexpensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution\nsemantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another\nline of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer\nnatural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more\nLLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively\nrefine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their\nquery plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven\nanalytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of\nsemantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep\nResearch systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype\nwhich enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic\noperator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can\noutperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research\nsystems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,\nour prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we\ngive the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still\nachieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its\noptimized execution."}

Unfortunately, today's\ncollective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical\ninformation needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a\nlightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to\naddress previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.\nMycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage\ninternal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM\ntraining. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug\ncollective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies\nwithin 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20\nseconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection\nexperiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency."}

Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through\ninstruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may\nsignificantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational\nresources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue\nthat knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable\nfor fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to\nfingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.\nDespite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being\noverwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning\n(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the\nfingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even\nin the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the\nfingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and\nsimilar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding\nunderscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting\ninjection methods for LLMs."}

In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are\nconsolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While\nvirtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,\nit cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such\nas last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to\nsevere performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM\nscheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction\nto mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds\ndue to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.\nTo address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch\nTransformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in\nblack-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and\nsystem-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second\nresolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the\nmodel to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload\nconditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we\nprovide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal\nresolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization\nacross diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a\nmean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement\nin predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%."}
