### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，解决深度学习模型对虚假相关性的依赖问题，提升模型泛化能力和分布外鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型经常学习和利用训练数据中的虚假相关性，使用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和在未见数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出CounterBias Augmentation (CoBA)框架：1) 将文本分解为主语-谓语-宾语三元组；2) 选择性修改这些三元组以破坏虚假相关性；3) 从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够同时处理多种偏见（如性别偏见、简单性偏见），有效应对虚假相关性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个大规模德语数据集，包含毒性标注和平台提供的年龄估计，揭示了不同年龄段用户的网络毒性言论模式差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景信息，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人工标注和LLM标注的混合标注流程

Result: 数据集包含3,024条人工标注和30,024条LLM标注的评论，16.7%被标记为有问题。发现年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更多参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该资源为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，推理模型能减轻该效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在真实世界应用中的认知偏见，特别是锚定效应对价格谈判可靠性的影响

Method: 使用卖方LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判表现，分析推理和人格因素与锚定效应的关系

Result: LLM像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLM的认知偏见，促进LLM在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基础视觉感知任务上的表现，发现即使是最先进的模型在简单形状和结构识别任务上表现不佳，且性能随任务复杂度增加而显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但缺乏对基础视觉感知能力的系统评估，特别是在程序生成的纯净图像上的简单形状识别能力

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在基础感知任务上表现不佳，性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降，不同模型在不同认知技能上表现出相似的趋势

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上的优秀表现并不能代表其基础视觉感知能力，需要更全面的评估框架来理解模型的真实能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: 科学大语言模型(Sci-LLMs)的数据中心综述，从模型与数据的共同进化角度探讨科学知识表征、多模态挑战、评估方法和自主科学发现系统的发展路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学大语言模型在科学研究中带来革命性变革，但其发展受到科学数据复杂性的形式，需要从数据中心角度进行系统性分析与综合

Method: 构建统一的科学数据分类法和层次化知识模型，系统评佰近270个训练数据集和190个测试数据集，分析多模态、跨尺度、预克性等科学特有挑战

Result: 揭示了科学数据的异质性、多尺度性和不确定性特征，识别了评估方法从静态考试向过程和发现导向的转变，提出了半自动标注流程和循环系统的解决方案

Conclusion: 本研究为建立可信赖、持续进化的AI系统提供了路线图，运用Sci-LLMs的自主组织可以为加速科学发现做出真正贡献

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在评估时存在显著标签偏见，ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude的评估结果受模型标签影响严重，错误标签可导致排名反转和高达50个百分点的评分变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签偏见的影响，以确保评估的公平性

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分来进行自评估和交叉评估

Result: 发现明显的评估不对称性："Claude"标签始终提高分数，"Gemini"标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常导致排名反转，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude的自偏好加剧

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择信息增益最大的问题，显著提升了多轮对话中的信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型在多轮对话中智能、自适应地从用户或外部来源收集信息的能力，使其成为更有效的对话代理

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型，并设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，BED-LLM相比直接提示和其他自适应策略取得了显著性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架来智能收集信息，在多轮对话任务中表现出色，是提升LLM交互能力的重要进展

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习和GRPO算法自动化HFACS分析的方法，小型专业化模型在航空安全分析中超越大型模型，减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高航空安全分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用强化学习组相对策略优化(GRPO)策略微调Llama-3.1 8B模型，统合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术来解决数据类不平衡问题。

Result: 模型性能显著提升，精确匹配准确率提高350%（从0.0400到0.1800），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等领先模型。

Conclusion: 小型领域优化模型能够提供更高效、更优秀的安全分析方案，适合在资源受限边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动导致的拼写攻击，性能显著下降，主要源于子词分词器的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表征替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，构建像素级生成语言模型

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了方法对拼写噪声的鲁棒性和多语言环境下的有效性

Conclusion: 像素级表示方法为解决语言模型的拼写攻击脆弱性提供了有效解决方案，同时扩展了对多语言文本的兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现语音模型在音位习得方面没有明显的关键期效应证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型中是否存在人类语言习得的关键期效应，即第二语言学习开始时间延迟导致学习难度增加，以及第一语言接触结束时间延迟导致母语保持更好的现象。

Method: 在儿童导向语音数据上训练自监督语音模型，控制不同的第二语言训练开始时间和第一语言训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型没有表现出明显的音位习得关键期效应。延迟第二语言接触开始时间的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触结束时间导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在音位层面没有复制人类语言习得的关键期效应模式，这与基于文本的语言模型的研究结果不同，表明语音处理可能具有不同的学习机制。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在句子级生成上表现不佳，自一致性方法计算成本高，存在冗余的共享前缀标记

Method: 识别自一致性方法中的冗余（共享前缀标记），提出解码记忆管道（DMP），采用选择性推理和退火解码策略

Result: 实验显示方法实现最高3倍加速，且AUROC性能不下降

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

### [17] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过统计学上的"正态性"概念重新解读图灵测试，认为图灵测试是对普通人类智力的测试，而非超常智力。论文指出像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型目标是人类中的优秀智力，因此很难通过图灵测试，它们更像人工智能，而非真正的人工智力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新考虑图灵测试的概念基础，探讨统计学中的"正态性"概念如何帮助理解图灵测试的本质，以及该测试对于理解人类认知的意义。

Method: 从统计学和规范性的角度出发，分析图灵测试中的"平均人类询问者"概念，认为这应该理解为多个判断者评价的统计恒量，而非单个非专业判断者。

Result: 得出两点主要结论：1）像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型目标是人类中的优秀智力，因此很难通过图灵测试；2）图灵测试能否有助于理解人类认知取决于人类智力是否可以约化为平均智力的问题。

Conclusion: 图灵测试实质上是一种对普通智力的测试，而今天的大语言模型更像人工智能（artificial smartness）而非真正的人工智力。这个讨论超越了图灵测试本身，质疑了整个正态化范式的概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查自动文本摘要评估中的可复现性挑战，发现文献报告性能与实际实验结果之间存在显著差异，需要建立公平透明的评估标准

Method: 基于SummEval数据集构建统一开源评估框架，对6种代表性评估指标（包括经典ROUGE和新兴LLM方法G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行对比实验

Result: 发现评估指标存在结构性权衡：与人类判断对齐度最高的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限可复现性等问题

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被用作自动审稿生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑错误方面的具体能力和局限性，以确保科学诚信。

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种自动审稿生成器方法检测研究逻辑错误的能力。

Result: 研究发现，与研究预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对自动审稿生成器的输出评论没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了三个可操作的建议用于未来工作，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用MLLM能力或作为求解器评估，缺乏针对医疗场景的专业评估维度（如诊断准确性和临床相关性），医疗奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注案例的多模态数据集，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据，覆盖6个临床关键维度，评估32个先进MLLM模型并开发基线模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在显著挑战，通过微调的基线模型表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗MLLM的专业对齐提供了重要基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，从大语言模型词嵌入中分解出多个子嵌入，识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法往往依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示细粒度语义子维度的新方法。

Method: 引入DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按照不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解为子维度的关键因素；神经相关性分析支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，揭示了语义组织的内在结构，并通过神经证据验证了这些子维度的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [22] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了"意识形态深度"概念来衡量LLMs内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操纵性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现不同模型在意识形态稳定性上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面层级的响应往往可以通过简单的提示工程来操纵，这让人质疑它们是否反映了连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 使用指令提示和激活引导测量两个开源LLMs的"可操纵性"；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制。

Result: 发现可操纵性较低的模型拥有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，一个模型可能包含比相似规模模型多7.3倍的政治特征。对意识形态"深度"模型的核心政治特征进行针对性消融会导致相关主题推理的一致逻辑转变，而在"浅层"模型中相同干预会导致拒绝输出增加。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs可量化的属性，可操纵性可作为窥探其潜在政治架构的有价值窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型创意写作能力强但计算成本高，小语言模型是替代方案但现有方法存在新颖性不足和成本高的问题

Method: 使用两种AI奖励策略：1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2) 基于对抗训练优化的原则引导LLM评判器

Result: 两种方法都显著提升创意输出，但原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法生成质量更优，训练效率更高，减少对人类标注数据的依赖

Conclusion: 原则引导的LLM评判器方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，自动化评估方法与人类判断高度一致

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理偏见使人们容易相信和传播假新闻，集成学习方法虽然有效但性能严重依赖于分类器的多样性，而选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织到不同粒度级别的组中，然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别为每个级别选择一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性，最后选择最多样化的池用于集成构建

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和现有最先进基线

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动选择多样化分类器有效提升了集成学习在假新闻检测中的性能，为解决分类器冗余问题提供了新思路

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5

evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同进化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

TL;DR: QZhou-Embedding是基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的通用文本嵌入模型，通过多任务框架、数据合成管道和两阶段训练策略，在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量多样化数据提升检索模型性能。

Method: 采用统一多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略；利用LLM API构建数据合成管道（转述、增强、硬负例生成）；实施两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Result: 在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中排名第一（2025年8月27日），在重排序、聚类等任务上同时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 高质量多样化数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM生成能力可以进一步优化数据质量，实现嵌入模型的突破。模型权重已在HuggingFace开源。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Misviz基准数据集，包含2,604个真实世界可视化图表，标注了12种误导类型，并发布了包含81,814个合成图表的Misviz-synth数据集，用于训练和评估误导性可视化检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型的训练和评估因缺乏大型、多样化且公开可用的数据集而受限。

Method: 创建了Misviz真实数据集和Misviz-synth合成数据集，使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 研究结果显示，检测误导性可视化仍然是一个极具挑战性的任务，现有模型在此任务上表现有限。

Conclusion: 通过发布Misviz基准数据集和合成数据集，为研究社区提供了重要的资源，有助于开发更好的误导性可视化检测方法，保护读者免受错误信息影响。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种核心参数隔离精细调整框架(CPI-FT)，通过识别任务特定的核心参数区域并使用参数融合技术，有效缓解了多任务精细调整中的任务干扰和恐怖遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多任务精细调整中出现的"泵泵板现象"，即某些任务性能提升以损害其他任务为代价的问题。

Method: 首先独立精细调整每个任务以识别核心参数区域，然后将核心区域相似的任务分组。使用参数融合技术：核心参数直接移植到统一背榜，非核心参数通过球面线性插值(SLERP)平滑融合。最后使用混合任务数据进行轻量级管线式训练，冻结之前任务的核心区域。

Result: 在多个公开测试集上的实验表明，该方法显著缓解了任务干扰和恐怖遗忘问题，性能一质超过传统的多任务和多阶段精细调整基线。

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和融合技术，有效解决了多任务精细调整中的性能交互问题，为大语言模型的多任务适配提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务，针对需要从文本中推断细微数值属性的场景，并开发了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在基准测试中相比基线方法提升达65%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中进行深度分析来推断数值属性，但现有的提示冻结LLM和微调Transformer编码器方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化（通过分析批量数据来优化提示）和神经集成学习（整合多个模型的预测），该方法简单轻量且适用于有限的任务特定训练数据和计算资源的情况。

Result: 在三个现实问题构建的RiR基准测试中，MENTAT方法相比提示冻结LLMs和微调Transformer编码器两种基线方法，取得了最高65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MENTAT方法在推理密集型回归任务上表现出显著优势，但此类任务仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然对候选推理链进行评分，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来选择正确推理链的关键挑战。

Method: 提出PiCSAR方法，使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: 在多个基准测试上取得显著提升（MATH500 +10.18，AIME2025 +9.81），在20次比较中16次以至少2倍少的样本优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具，能够有效支持大规模训练数据集的质量监控和分析

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种混合字符串相似性、主题建模和层次聚类的方法，用于聚类银行支付消息中的交易对手实体名称，解决传统自然语言模型在这类短文本聚类中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自然语言模型适用于长文本聚类，但对于银行支付消息中的手动输入的实体名称（如SWIFT系统），这些名称缺乏句子结构且含有噪声和变体，导致现有方法效果不佳。需要一种专门的方法来聚类这类交易对手实体。

Method: 提出了一种混合方法流水线，结合字符串相似性、主题建模、层次聚类和规则基础方法。该方法能够处理未知聚类数量的情况，并且设计了基于精准率和召回率的评估指标。

Result: 在真实标签数据集上进行测试，证明该方法在性能上显著提升，远超基准的规则基础方法（关键字匹配）。方法保留了规则系统的可解释性，同时减少了手动审查的需求。

Conclusion: 该混合方法有效解决了银行支付消息中交易对手实体聚类的挑战，提供了比传统方法更好的性能和风险控制能力，尤其在制裁调查等场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出基于GAMEEMO数据集的统一多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，使用LSTM-GRU模型在二元效价分类中达到0.932 F1分数，在多类和多标签分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究大多局限于二元效价预测或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 采用结构化预处理策略（时间窗分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化），构建多粒度情绪标签（二元效价、多类分类、多标签表示），评估多种机器学习模型和深度学习架构。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二元效价任务中获得0.932 F1分数，在多类和多标签情绪分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的多粒度框架在EEG情绪识别方面表现出色，LSTM-GRU模型在各种分类任务中均取得最优性能，为真实情感计算系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Motivation: 现有的无评论家强化学习方法（特别是组策略方法）严重依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势值，这容易导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本

Method: 使用参考模型提前进行rollout计算奖励分数作为参考锚点，通过数据预采样评估样本难度并选择高增益数据，有效纠正组内比较带来的累积偏差并减少对rollout次数的依赖

Result: 在跨两个领域的9个数据集上的实验表明，PVPO达到了最先进的性能，在多个任务上展现出强大的泛化能力，并在不同规模的模型上表现出可扩展的性能

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样机制，有效解决了无评论家强化学习方法的局限性，实现了更高的训练效率和更好的性能表现

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性，而全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模相关性但计算和内存成本过高

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构

Result: 数值实验显示，使用秩5及更小秩近似时，AdaGram比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of

Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing

time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

TL;DR: 提出PILOT方法，将LLM路由建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过共享嵌入空间和在线学习实现自适应模型选择，同时考虑成本约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督学习方法需要完整的查询-LLM配对知识，但现实场景中缺乏这种完整映射且查询不断变化，需要更自适应的路由方案。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，使用离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过LinUCB扩展算法PILOT进行在线学习，并引入多选择背包问题处理成本约束。

Result: 提出了能够自适应选择最适合LLM的路由框架，无需对所有查询进行完整推理，同时考虑资源效率。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文老虎机问题是有效的，PILOT方法能够实现自适应、成本感知的模型选择，适用于现实世界的动态环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

TL;DR: 提出Gen-LRA方法，通过评估测试观测对合成数据局部似然比估计的影响，无需模型知识即可有效检测生成模型的隐私泄露问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据隐私审计框架依赖启发式方法和不合理假设，检测训练数据通过合成数据发布暴露隐私的能力有限

Method: 基于生成模型倾向于过度拟合训练分布特定区域的观察，设计无模型假设的No-Box成员推理攻击，通过评估测试观测对替代模型局部似然比估计的影响

Result: 在涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上始终优于其他生成模型MIA方法

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具非常有效，突显了生成模型过度拟合在现实应用中带来的重大隐私风险

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出深度残差回声状态网络(DeepResESN)，通过时间残差连接提升传统ESN的长时信息处理能力，在多种时间序列任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回声状态网络(ESN)在处理长时信息方面存在困难，需要改进网络结构来增强记忆容量和长时建模能力

Method: 基于时间残差连接构建深度未训练RNN，采用正交配置的残差连接（随机生成和固定结构），并进行数学稳定性分析

Result: 深度残差结构显著提升了记忆容量和长时时间建模能力，在多种时间序列任务上优于传统浅层和深度储备池计算

Conclusion: 深度残差回声状态网络通过层次化残差连接有效解决了传统ESN的长时信息处理限制，为时间序列建模提供了新的有效方法

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Motivation: 现有树集成遗忘方法通常针对特定模型或依赖离散树结构，难以泛化到复杂集成且在大规模数据集上效率低下

Method: 将遗忘样本问题构建为基于梯度的优化任务，采用概率模型近似来适应树集成的不可微性，实现端到端遗忘

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FUTURE能够产生显著且成功的遗忘性能

Conclusion: FUTURE算法有效解决了树集成模型在隐私保护场景下的数据遗忘问题，提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过变分原理和复制子流理论，形式化地描述了LLM解码过程中下一个token分布的平滑轨迹收敛过程，揭示了温度、top-k和nucleus采样的数学本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM解码过程通常被描述为token评分和softmax归一化，但缺乏严格的数学形式化描述。本文旨在从变分原理角度为这一过程提供最小化自包含的理论框架。

Method: 采用约束变分原理和概率单纯形上的离散乘法权重（熵镜像）更新方法，分析其连续时间极限下的复制子流，证明next-token分布的收敛性质。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，next-token分布沿单纯形内平滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡点；温度是时间的精确缩放，top-k和nucleus采样将流限制在特定面上。

Conclusion: 为LLM解码过程提供了严格的数学框架，形式化了"流形遍历"直觉，揭示了各种采样技术的数学本质，为理解路径依赖分数调整和幻觉行为奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，大语言模型强化学习中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练效果等同全数据集、奖励信号无需精确等）仅在模型与任务高度对齐时出现，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现大语言模型强化学习中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象适用的具体条件和边界尚不明确，需要系统研究来理解这些观察结果何时成立、何时失效。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域上检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注预训练模型与任务的对齐程度（用pass@k准确率衡量）这一关键因素。

Result: 研究发现标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果只在模型与任务已经表现出强对齐时才会出现。在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，反直觉现象仅在对齐良好时有效，而在困难场景中传统RL方法仍然不可或缺。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于自组织映射(SOM)和变分自编码器(VAE)的生成式持续学习框架，无需存储原始数据或任务标签，通过SOM单元统计信息生成合成样本进行高效回放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中内存效率低的问题，传统方法需要存储大量原始数据样本或任务标签，限制了在资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 结合SOM和VAE：高维数据（如CIFAR）在VAE潜在空间进行SOM操作，低维数据（如MNIST）直接使用SOM。存储每个SOM单元的均值、方差和协方差统计量，用于生成合成样本进行回放。

Result: 在标准类增量基准测试中表现优异，与最先进的内存方法竞争，显著优于无内存方法。在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别提升近10%和7%的单类增量性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展、无需任务标签且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，同时支持学习过程可视化和训练后作为生成模型使用。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD仿真计算成本高，而现有ML代理模型架构多样但无单一最优方案，需要利用架构多样性提升预测性能

Method: 使用门控网络动态组合三种异构代理模型(DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet、FigConvNet)，通过熵正则化防止模型坍塌，在DrivAerML数据集上训练验证

Result: MoE模型在所有评估物理量上均显著降低L-2预测误差，优于集成平均和最准确的单个专家模型

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专业架构的互补优势，为构建更鲁棒准确的复合代理模型提供了有效策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 重要性补丁(RelP)新方法，采用层状重要性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时提高了激活补丁的近似准确性和忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活补丁在机制解释性中属于标准方法，但计算成本高；归因补丁计算快速但在深度非线性网络中存在噪声和可靠性低的问题。

Method: 重要性补丁(RelP)使用层状重要性传播(LRP)的传播系数替代归因补丁中的本地梯度，保持了相同的计算效率(2次前向+1次向后)，同时确保重要性保存和更好的信噪比。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上验证，RelP比标准归因补丁更准确地近似激活补丁。在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，对于MLP输出，归因补丁相关系数仅0.006，而RelP达到0.956。与积分梯度法(IG)相比，RelP达到相似的忠实性但无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: RelP提供了一种高效、高忠实性的激活补丁近似方法，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了准确性，尤其适用于深度非线性网络的机制解释性分析。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确评估客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择有用客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样客户端。

Result: 在相同评估预算下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中比最先进基线方法获得高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，有效解决了联邦学习中客户端贡献评估的计算复杂度问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出了一个评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的框架，通过测量模型在顺序标注未标注数据集时累积的错误来量化早期学习成本，弥补了传统只关注最终准确率的评估缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估过于强调最终准确率，忽视了模型从零开始学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。G&L旨在填补这一空白，量化模型在冷启动情况下的适应性表现。

Method: 设计了四个评估轨道（Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch），通过顺序选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数的流程，测量错误轨迹。在MNIST和AG News数据集上测试了传统方法、卷积架构和预训练transformer模型。

Result: 发现小模型在早期阶段能以更少错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异。所有当前模型性能都远低于理论oracle参考带，显示出明显的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L框架通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发既能在极限情况下准确又能从第一个样本开始就可靠的学习者提供了可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Method: 基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流式环境中有效维持了高性能异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法依赖存储先前任务的样本或使用复杂正则化，面临数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降等挑战。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段框架：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段使用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了持续学习中的数据隐私和存储效率问题，证明了其在不同领域的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

TL;DR: VILA是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过更准确地识别与敏感信息相关的参数并减少对完整模型参数的访问需求，显著提高了参数效率和训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs无意中生成敏感信息的问题，避免重新训练模型的高计算成本，同时改进现有FILA方法在Fisher信息假设和参数访问方面的不足。

Method: 提出VILA框架，明确考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性；通过避免访问完整模型参数来降低计算成本。

Result: 相比FILA，VILA实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升，在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数识别方法和减少计算需求，为机器遗忘提供了一个高效且准确的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，特别针对使用代理状态（如RNN状态）而非信念状态的算法，以及使用策略正则化的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Q-learning理论分析主要针对基于信念状态或信息状态的算法，而实践中广泛使用的算法往往使用代理状态（如神经网络隐藏状态）并采用策略正则化技术，这些算法的收敛性缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出了正则化代理状态Q-learning（RASQL）框架，分析了在温和技术条件下算法的收敛性，证明其收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点依赖于行为策略的平稳分布。

Result: 理论分析表明RASQL算法能够收敛，并且类似的收敛分析也适用于学习周期性策略的RASQL变体。数值实验验证了理论收敛行为与理论极限的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为实践中广泛使用的Q-learning算法提供了理论收敛保证，填补了理论分析与实际算法之间的差距，特别是针对使用代理状态和策略正则化的算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过在批次级别进行特征选择来解决传统TopK SAE的效率问题，并通过可调节的参数l在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间找到平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的TopK SAE方法对每个token使用固定的K个最活跃特征，效率低下且无法处理不同token信息量的差异。BatchTopK方法虽然提高了平均重建质量，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅值特征会挤掉信息量更大但幅值较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：首先通过L2范数或熵对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分，形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后在该受限特征池中对批次中的token应用Top-K选择。参数l控制选择范围，l=1时仅从K个全局重要特征中选择，l较大时接近标准BatchTopK。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的方法家族，通过参数l提供了在全局一致性和token特异性特征之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff是一种基于扩散模型的分阶段生成模型，专门用于生成长时间序列，通过阶段化生成和跨阶段信息传递来平衡长期依赖性和数据分布漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间序列具有复杂的长期时间模式和分布漂移，传统生成模型难以同时处理长期依赖关系和特征序列间的复杂相互关系。

Method: 采用分阶段序列生成和跨阶段信息传递，在每个阶段内进行渐进式序列分解实现通道独立建模，跨阶段使用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过创新的分阶段生成架构，成功解决了长时间序列生成中的长期依赖性和分布漂移平衡问题，为复杂时间序列生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DLGAN模型，通过双层生成对抗网络解决时间序列合成中时间依赖性和特征捕获问题，将生成过程分解为特征提取和序列重建两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列合成方法基于随机序列进行时间建模，难以保证生成时间序列的时间依赖性，且直接从随机序列建模难以准确捕获原始时间序列的特征信息。

Method: DLGAN模型将时间序列生成过程分解为序列特征提取和序列重建两个阶段，形成完整的时间序列自编码器，并使用GAN生成与真实序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在各种评估指标上都表现出优越性。

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够确保生成的时间序列具有正确的时间依赖性，并准确捕获原始时间序列的特征信息。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 基于梯度噪声的重尾分布特性和Edge of Stability现象，旨在解决大规模神经网络优化中过度依赖训练损失导致的泛化问题

Method: AHTSGD在训练早期注入重尾噪声增强探索，随着锐度稳定逐渐过渡到轻尾噪声，动态适应损失景观的锐度变化

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准测试中 consistently优于SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现尤为突出

Conclusion: AHTSGD能够加速从不良初始化的早期训练，提高在干净和噪声设置下的泛化能力，且对学习率选择具有鲁棒性

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Method: 扩展logit lens方法分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，考察各层的棋力、解题能力和策略分布轨迹

Result: 发现棋力和解题能力呈现强单调趋势，但策略分布经常呈现非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解法、与最终输出相关性差的走法排序，以及直到网络后期仍存在的高策略分歧

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程比语言模型观察到的平滑分布收敛更为复杂，存在显著的非平滑计算特征

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM实现了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: CoM通过有效缓解协变量偏移引起的性能退化，能够产生连贯的合并模型，解决了深度网络层间依赖的合并挑战

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Result: 在具有挑战性的模拟环境中，该算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够同时从整体平均和时间平均中受益，为RL在现实世界部署提供了更好的性能保证

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的不确定性量化可以显著改善探索性和鲁棒性，但现有研究过于关注后验近似精度，而忽略了先验和似然假设的准确性。

Method: 通过实证研究先验分布，使用统计检验验证高斯似然假设的合理性，并提出改进的先验分布解决方案。

Result: 发现贝叶斯深度Q学习存在冷后验效应（性能随后验温度降低而提升），统计检验显示高斯似然假设经常被违反。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出使用失败预测作为早期退出模型的更佳性能代理指标，因为检查温度方法存在偏差且无法保持样本排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的早期退出模型主要依靠信心基础的退出策略，但检查温度指标可能是误导性的，因为良好检查温度的分类器仍可能浪费计算资源。

Method: 研究人员分析了检查温度方法的局限性，并提出使用失败预测作为替代方案。失败预测考虑了样本排名的变化，与效率提升呈现强相关性。

Result: 实验结果显示，在某些情况下失检温度的网络甚至超过了检查温度的网络。失败预测方法与早期退出模型的效率提升呈现出更强的相关性。

Conclusion: 失败预测是设计和评估早期退出模型的更可靠基础，因为它更能够反映模型的实际效率改善情况。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Transformer决策智能体依赖密集矩阵运算，能耗高不适合边缘设备；脉冲神经网络具有超低功耗特性但尚未与回报条件序列建模结合

Method: 在自注意力块中嵌入泄漏积分发放神经元，端到端训练，采用替代梯度、生物启发三因子可塑性、相移脉冲位置编码和轻量级树突路由模块

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中匹配或超越标准决策Transformer性能，每个决策发射少于10个脉冲，推理能耗降低4个数量级

Conclusion: SNN-DT将序列建模与神经形态效率结合，为嵌入式可穿戴设备开辟了实时低功耗控制的新途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在高风险决策任务中的应用增加，需要评估其在表格数据处理中的性能和公平性，特别是在贷款审批等金融领域

Method: 使用来自加纳、德国和美国的序列化贷款审批数据集，评估LLM的零样本学习和上下文学习能力，比较不同序列化格式的效果

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT能提高F1分数但加剧公平性差距；ICL相对零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异

Conclusion: 需要开发有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型，以提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型在少样本表格分类中具有潜力，但由于结构化数据的变异性面临挑战，需要将数据蒸馏为可操作的洞察来提高分类效果。

Method: 提出InsightTab框架，采用分而治之、先易后难和反思学习的原则，结合大语言模型和数据建模技术进行规则总结、策略性示例选择和洞察反思。

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

TL;DR: 本文通过图里奇曲率分析发现，随机k-SAT公式生成的二分图具有固有负曲率特性，且曲率随问题难度增加而减小，这导致GNN求解器出现过度压缩问题，限制了其在困难SAT实例上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在布尔可满足性问题求解中表现优异，但在困难实例上性能急剧下降，需要探究这是否反映了根本性的架构限制。

Method: 使用图里奇曲率分析随机k-SAT公式生成的二分图的几何特性，理论证明其负曲率特性，并通过实验验证曲率与问题复杂度的关系。

Result: 发现随机k-SAT公式的二分图具有固有负曲率，曲率随难度增加而减小；GNN求解器因此受到过度压缩现象影响；曲率是问题复杂度的强指标并能预测性能。

Conclusion: 图曲率分析为GNN在SAT求解中的局限性提供了几何解释，为现有求解器设计原则提供了理论支撑，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Result: 证明在不产生显著性能损失的情况下，大幅减少推断数据在技术上是可行的

Conclusion: 数据最小化在技术上可行，但实际应用面临挑战，其实用性受到技术设置和用户特征的强烈影响，导致难以实施通用的数据"必要性"标准

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动方法在智能电网建模中的数据稀缺和物理一致性不足的问题，通过将物理定律直接整合到学习框架中，提升模型的泛化能力和物理可行性。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络（PINNs）作为替代模型，通过基于物理的损失函数（如功率平衡、操作约束和电网稳定性）进行训练，并与XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归在插值、交叉验证和 episodic 轨迹预测三个实验中进行比较。

Result: PINNs在泛化能力上优于传统数据驱动模型，误差降低明显，在动态电网操作中保持较低的MAE，并能可靠捕获状态转换，而传统模型表现不稳定。尽管在极端操作 regime 中有轻微性能下降，但PINNs始终强制物理可行性。

Conclusion: PINNs作为智能电网替代模型的范式转换工具，结合了数据驱动的灵活性和第一性原理的严谨性，对实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生有重要推进作用，强调了在关键任务能源系统中物理感知架构的必要性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Motivation: 研究社交媒体参与度（点赞和评论）的预测方法，探索情感和时间特征对用户参与行为的影响机制。

Method: 使用包含600首歌曲的情感标注数据集（效价、唤醒度和情感指标），采用基于HistGradientBoostingRegressor的多目标回归模型，对经过对数变换的参与度比率进行训练。

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异(R^2=0.98)，但在评论预测上效果有限(R^2=0.41)，表明情感和时间元数据结合现有观看次数能有效预测未来参与度。

Conclusion: 点赞行为主要由情感和曝光信号驱动且易于捕捉，而评论行为依赖于当前特征集中未包含的其他因素，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature

Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测挑战

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为决定性成分（对分类输出贡献最大）和非显著成分（贡献最小）。远OOD时利用非显著子空间，近OOD时专注于决定性子空间

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，可以找到对OOD检测更有效的特征子空间，远OOD和近OOD需要不同的处理策略，ActSub方法有效结合了这两种策略

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 估计社区特定的精神健康效应对公共卫生政策至关重要。传统的精神健康预测提供的见解有限，而几何实验设计如LRDD能够从观测数据中推断更接近因果关系的效应。

Method: 将LRDD适配到统计学习框架中，通过社区历史数据、动态协变量和外生变量来预测未来的时间特定断点和斜率变化。应用于预测COVID-19事件对美国县级焦虑水平的影响。

Result: 任务很难，但模型趋于复杂时效果更好。最佳结果来自整合外生和动态协变量，在断点预测上相关系数达到+0.46，斜率预测达到+0.65，显著改善了传统静态社区表征方法。

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假想事件对特定社区的特异效应开启了新可能性，在公共健康预测领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAC开发了SNL框架和Auto-SNL工具，用于在FPGA上部署实时机器学习推理模型，解决了LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生的高达1TB/s数据流的实时处理挑战，相比现有工具hls4ml在延迟和资源使用方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1MHz的X射线脉冲和超过1TB/s的数据流，传统数据传输和存储成本过高，而常规机器学习实现引入过多延迟，无法满足高速实验环境的实时数据处理需求。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，专门用于在FPGA上部署实时ML推理模型，支持动态更新模型权重而无需FPGA重新合成。同时开发Auto-SNL Python扩展，简化将Python神经网络模型转换为SNL兼容的高级合成代码的过程。

Result: 与当前最先进工具hls4ml的基准测试比较显示，SNL在大多数测试的神经网络架构中实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，在某些情况下还提供了FPGA资源节省。

Conclusion: SNL展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机会，解决了高速数据流的实时机器学习处理挑战。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: UniMLR是一种新的多标签排序范式，通过利用正标签之间的排序信息来建模类别相关性概率分布，统一了排序和分类任务，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签排序方法仅利用标签的二分类信息（正/负），忽略了正标签之间的排序信息，无法充分利用类别相关性的差异。

Method: 提出UniMLR框架，将隐式类别相关性建模为概率分布，利用正标签的排序信息而非简单等权处理。同时构建了8个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）来解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Result: 统计验证表明该方法能准确学习与真实排序一致的正标签排序表示，且与底层显著性值成比例。在合成和真实数据集上的实验证明了框架的价值。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过统一排序和分类任务，充分利用正标签排序信息，为多标签排序提供了新的有效范式，并通过合成数据集解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心率预测在现实部署中面临数据异质性挑战，包括设备源异质性（不同设备特征集不同）和用户异质性（不同用户和活动的生理模式差异），现有方法无法同时处理这两种异质性

Method: 使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，使模型对不同的特征集具有鲁棒性；采用时间感知注意力模块捕捉长期生理特征，并结合对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比现有基线方法提升17%和15%的性能，学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示在下游应用中具有实用价值，并发布了新的基准数据集ParroTao

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-Health是一个新颖的混合专家框架，用于处理医疗保健中多模态数据融合问题，能够有效应对现实世界中不同患者和机构间数据可用性差异的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗系统产生多样化的多模态数据（EHR、临床记录、医学图像），但现有方法通常需要完整模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，采用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活适应不同数据可用性场景。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务（院内死亡率预测、长期住院预测、再入院预测）中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法表现出更优越的性能，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在数据可用性异质的多样化医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数，大幅减少可训练参数数量，在GLUE任务上性能优于全微调和标准LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法需要学习两个更新矩阵，而SVD变体初始化成本高且奇异向量难以解释。需要一种更高效、结构更清晰的参数高效微调方法。

Method: 使用QR分解与列主元提取预训练权重的正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA仅用601个参数就能达到或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA的性能，参数减少1000倍以上。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过正交基表示提供清晰的适应结构，大幅减少参数数量，同时保持或提升性能，为大规模语言模型的高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为解决方案，但需要同时解决隐私和公平性问题

Method: 使用基于Transformer的变分自编码器+潜在扩散模型，在训练中应用Rényi差分隐私约束，通过平衡采样和潜在空间神经元激活模式对齐来确保公平性

Result: 实验结果表明FLIP在差分隐私约束下有效提升了任务无关公平性，并在多种下游任务中表现出色

Conclusion: FLIP为隐私保护下的公平数据生成提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

TL;DR: FaSTED算法利用GPU张量核心的FP16-32混合精度计算欧氏距离，通过数据层次化重用和内存优化，在相似性搜索中实现2.5-51倍加速，精度损失小于0.06%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU张量核心具有高计算吞吐量，但之前研究仅使用FP64精度。利用FP16-32混合精度可以显著提升欧氏距离计算性能，但需要解决数据饥饿问题。

Method: 提出FaSTED算法，设计数据层次化重用机制，优化全局内存、共享内存和寄存器使用，最大化内存利用率，支持混合精度计算。

Result: 在4个真实高维数据集（128-960维度）上，相比现有最佳算法实现2.5-51倍加速，与FP64基准相比精度损失小于0.06%。

Conclusion: 利用张量核心的混合精度计算可以显著提升欧氏距离计算性能，FaSTED算法在保持高精度的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

Method: 开发了CORRECT这一GitHub Action工具，支持在远程HPC资源上安全执行测试，结合持续集成(CI)和完整的溯源信息来替代直接资源访问。

Result: 在三种不同类型的HPC应用上评估了CORRECT的可用性，证明该工具能够有效自动化和记录复现性评估过程。

Conclusion: 更好的HPC兼容CI解决方案（如CORRECT）能够显著改善HPC应用程序的复现性，为克服HPC环境下的复现性障碍提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

Motivation: 解决IoT应用在异构Cloud-Edge-IoT环境中的分布式调度优化挑战，包括固定神经网络架构不兼容计算异构性、非IID数据分布和跨域协作机制不足等问题

Method: 开发资源感知混合架构生成机制、隐私保护的环境聚类联邦学习方法、环境导向的跨架构知识蒸馏机制

Conclusion: KD-AFRL框架有效解决了多域IoT应用调度问题，在异构环境中表现出优异的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要强大的交易排序机制，并指出了新兴MEV策略对区块链网络的影响和挑战。

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练经常因各种故障而中断，需要强大的容错能力。现有的无备份方法（如冗余计算、动态并行和数据重路由）都存在性能损失问题。

Method: Odyssey通过统一的性能模型、快速执行计划搜索、准确性能估计和高效通信优化，智能选择最优恢复策略。

Result: 在32卡集群上的实验表明，Odyssey保持恢复后与无故障训练的性能差距在11.00%以内，同时保持模型收敛和高效内存使用。相比最先进方法，吞吐量分别比Oobleck和Recycle高1.229倍和1.355倍。

Conclusion: Odyssey系统通过自适应容错策略有效解决了大语言模型训练中的中断问题，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory

Motivation: 现有MoE模型卸载技术由于I/O瓶颈和稀疏计算问题，导致硬件利用率低下，需要新的方法来充分利用硬件资源

Method: 采用推测解码技术扩大每个专家的工作负载，通过理论和经验roofline分析协调GPU和CPU，开发专用CPU分块注意力验证内核，并集成自动超参数调优器

Result: 实验结果显示SpecMoEOff相比最先进的MoE卸载技术实现了最高2.5倍的解码吞吐量提升

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff通过推测解码有效解决了MoE模型卸载中的硬件利用率问题，显著提升了推理性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过架构设计来塑造LLMs在教学对话中的认知行为，特别是促进自适应、结构化的推理能力。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最佳，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为（抽象、自适应探测、概念连续性）。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造LLMs中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功实现了多本体系统的集成学习，通过双轴知识传播显著提升了医学概念表示学习效果，具有很好的实用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: TiG框架有效结合了大语言模型的知识推理能力和强化学习的交互学习优势，为复杂交互任务提供了透明可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Motivation: 当前音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测量一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要评估维度，不同评估之间难以进行模型比较。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括新的PARADE和CoRe-Bench合成数据集），标准化提示词、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开源和闭源ALMs模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个维度中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性，特别是公平性问题，该基准将持续更新以纳入新数据集和模型。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [108] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 学习滑动拼图游戏的lifted STRIPS模型，从仅包含瓦片位置的状态和简单动作标签（上下左右）的轨迹中学习，无需完整STRIPS状态和动作参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从部分可观测状态和缺少参数的动作中学习模型的问题，更贴近现实场景，之前的方法大多假设完整STRIPS状态或动作。

Method: 提出STRIPS+变体，允许隐式动作参数和有限存在量化，开发SYNTH算法通过构建分层前提表达式序列来学习模型。

Result: 建立了SYNTH算法的正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型轨迹上测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: STRIPS+框架和SYNTH算法能够有效处理部分可观测状态和隐式参数的动作学习问题，为更现实的模型学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个包含311个任务的基准测试，专门设计来评估多模态语言模型在需要深度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用的复杂网页浏览任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用方面的能力。

Method: 采用时空外推法构建任务，要求模型从空间线索（微文本、部件外观、布局、标识）和时间痕迹（广播叠加、季节背景）中提取信息，通过迭代的文本-图像搜索进行传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。

Result: 最强代理（o3）在没有搜索的情况下达到15.1%准确率，在框架下通过搜索达到36.0%准确率；而最强的开源模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct）在没有搜索时为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了当前多模态模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的关键失败点，为未来模型开发提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于模糊Z数的计算框架来测量智慧，将智慧量化为包含智慧分数和置信度分数的双属性表示，通过道德困境任务验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自我报告，无法反映智慧固有的谦逊和不确定性特征。需要一种能够同时考虑多维度和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学测量并实现人性化AI。

Method: 使用模糊推理系统结合Z数（每个决策用智慧分数和置信度分数表示），通过100名参与者对文化中性图画道德困境的口头反应，映射到5个智慧成分，使用21条规则和基于高斯核密度估计的隶属函数进行整合。

Result: 概念验证研究表明，系统产生的双属性智慧表示与现有量表存在适度但显著的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了收敛效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维的、考虑不确定性的构念，通过Z数操作化。除了推进心理学测量外，还为AI系统提供了可解释的、置信度敏感的推理能力，在严格计算和类人判断之间提供了安全的中庸之道。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实解释只能展示模型输出的最小修改，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性，需要新的解释方法来诊断故障和推理规划特性

Method: 基于LTLf公式定义期望属性，通过量化必须满足ψ的规划，提出两种定性反事实场景实例化，分析不同类型修改的计算复杂度

Result: 生成反事实场景的计算成本通常与计算规划相当，证明了方法的实际可行性

Conclusion: 提供了一个构建实用算法的框架，反事实场景解释范式能够有效捕捉问题的高层特性，具有较低的计算复杂度

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个基于GenAI的框架，通过集成多个大型语言模型(LLM)来自动解释流程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗流程挖掘的应用，使临床医生、数据科学家和研究人员更容易理解技术分析结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程挖掘在医疗领域面临技术复杂性高、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要一种简化应用的方法来促进其在医疗工作流分析中的使用。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，包装现有的Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)流程挖掘库，集成多个LLM进行自动流程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据进行概念验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动的解释，在将复杂流程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解方面代表了方法学上的创新进步。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种可在域范内自动泛化的重要野标发现框架，通过学习解决实例的状态函数来描述中间目标，构建可泛化重要野标图并用于规划问题的启发式搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重要野标提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够泛化到整个域范的方法来描述中间目标。

Method: 使用状态函数学习域范中的重要野标，这些函数与具体问题对象无关但适用于所有相似对象。构建有向泛化重要野标图来定义重要野标的进展，包括重复子计划的循环可能性。

Result: 实验结果显示，从少量小规模实例学习到的泛化重要野标图在同一域范的更大实例中也有效。如果识别出表示重复的循环，启发式性能比基准方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 泛化重要野标能够捐取可解释且对自动规划器有用的域范信息，这些信息可以从同一域范的少量计划中发现。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Result: IDPP方法能够有效解决当前Dec-POMDP解法器无法高效处理的大规模多代理规划问题。

Conclusion: 确定性分布式POMDP模型和IDPP解法为大规模多机器人规划问题提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数加速搜索，但只能一次性求解且需要精心设置膨胀因子，无法随时间持续改进解的质量

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发出随时多启发式A*（A-MHA*）算法

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域的实验表明，A-MHA*保持了原始MHA*的次优性和完备性保证，并能以随时方式运行

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，能够在保持理论保证的同时持续改进解质量，在多个领域表现出优于MHA*和其他随时算法的性能

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非追求共识，将偏见视为潜在优势，幻觉视为待验证假设，为医疗AI提供透明化诊断不确定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医疗AI将偏见视为需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见。作者认为偏见不可避免且可能有价值，需要新的方法来利用这种多样性

Method: 提出MEDLEY概念框架，协调多个AI模型同时保留其多样性输出。开发概念验证演示器，使用30多个大语言模型，在合成病例中同时保留共识和少数观点

Result: 演示器成功使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见透明化，便于临床监督。虽然还不是经过验证的临床工具，但展示了结构化多样性如何增强临床监督下的医疗推理

Conclusion: 通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，MEDLEY提供了范式转变，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

Conclusion: PosterForest框架能够生成具有优异信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好的高质量科学海报，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变分量子算法在旅行商问题中需要大量量子比特和每次求解都需要重新优化电路结构的问题，旨在开发一种更适合NISQ设备的可重用算法框架。

Method: 结合紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略：首先通过模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑结构，然后冻结该结构并在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示了方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等问题规模上表现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz结构可显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，未来可扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整的因果结构未知时。专家通常能够提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识的情况下，保证微观层面边可定向性的条件。假设可以获得相对于真实未知图的忠实且因果充分的分布。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也能适用。这些发现为利用SCG指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了将专家知识纳入观察性时间序列数据分析中以改进因果推理的价值，为利用摘要因果图进行微观层面因果发现提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以鼓励广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个多样化任务上评估：迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作和AntMaze多目标探索。TDP在所有任务上一致优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，有效解决了梯度引导的局限性，为测试时规划提供了灵活且强大的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

Motivation: 临床叙述的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一大语言模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的鲁棒性，需要更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用协作多智能体系统，模拟临床咨询团队。Manager智能体协调动态分配的专家智能体团队，通过分层迭代辩论达成共识，仅分析SOAP笔记中的主观和客观部分来识别临床问题。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III笔记数据集上评估，动态多智能体配置在识别三种疾病方面表现持续提升。定性分析显示该结构能有效呈现和权衡冲突证据，但偶尔可能出现群体思维。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.
