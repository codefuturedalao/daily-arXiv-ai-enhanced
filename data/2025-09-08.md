Conclusion: INSEva基准填补了保险领域AI评估的空白，揭示了当前大语言模型在保险专业应用中的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked boundless
possibilities, along with significant challenges. In response, we developed a
mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with
a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved
rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and

prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The
resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of
0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges. We
advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach and a long-term, responsible strategy
in developing such transformative technologies, recognizing both their
potential to change lives and the risks they may pose if not carefully managed.

### [3] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类视觉推理来解决MLLMs在无标注图表理解中的幻觉问题，并在新基准CRBench上取得了优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图表理解中存在严重的幻觉问题，特别是在处理无标注图表时性能显著下降。作者质疑MLLMs是否真正理解图表，并希望通过模拟人类的视觉推理能力来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过将估计过程建立在图表理解的基础上来模拟人类行为。该方法包括建立全面的图表推理基准CRBench，并开发了3B/7B参数的模型。

Result: ChartReasoner在CRBench上取得了优越的图表推理性能，甚至超越了GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash。在公开基准测试中也展现出强大的视觉推理能力，带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner成功引导MLLMs进行合理的图表理解，证明了通过模拟人类视觉推理可以有效解决MLLMs在图表理解中的幻觉问题，为图表理解领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接失败的主要原因是缺乏对本体标识符的接触，标识符使用频率是最强预测因子


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学NLP任务中表现良好，但在将本体术语链接到正确标识符时经常失败，需要探究失败原因

Method: 分析两个主要本体（人类表型本体和基因本体）和两个高性能模型（GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B）的预测，评估9个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的特征，进行单变量和多变量分析

Result: 暴露于本体标识符是链接成功的最强预测因子

Conclusion: 模型对本体标识符的接触程度是影响术语链接准确性的关键因素

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种不确定性驱动的协同系统，通过组合大型多模态语言模型和轻量级模型，在保持高准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）计算资源要求高与小型专门模型性能低之间的矛盾

Method: 不确定性驱动的级联机制，轻量模型先过滤样本，高不确定性样本才由MLLM处理，采用加权平均和提示验证等策略处理模糊预测

Result: 在标准数据集上达到最佳性能，计算资源需求仅为单独使用MLLM的一小部分

Conclusion: 该协同系统有效解决了性能与效率的矛盾，为多模态感知的实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

### [6] [CoCoNUTS: Concentrating on Content while Neglecting Uninformative Textual Styles for AI-Generated Peer Review Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04460)
*Yihan Chen,Jiawei Chen,Guozhao Mo,Xuanang Chen,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种从风格基础转向内容基础的AI评审检测方法，开发了CoCoNUTS标准数据集和CoCoDet检测器，以更准确地识别同行评审中的AI参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用AI文本检测器在同行评审场景中存在显著缺陷：容易受到重写攻击影响，无法区分表面语言精炼和实质内容生成，导致不公平地对待允许的AI语言增强评审，同时又无法检测偷偷人工智能化的AI生成评审。

Method: 构建了CoCoNUTS标准数据集，包含六种不同的人工智能协作模式的AI生成同行评审。开发了CoCoDet检测器，采用多任务学习框架，以实现更准确和稳健的AI参与检测。

Result: 该方法能够更准确地识别同行评审中的AI参与情况，提供了更可靠的检测结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估同行评审中大语言模型的使用提供了实用基础，并为实际学术应用开发更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法做出了贡献。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

### [7] [From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461)
*Tian Ma,Kaiyu Feng,Yu Rong,Kangfei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PtoP是一个基于大语言模型的MBTI人格预测框架，通过检索增强生成和合成少数类过采样技术解决LLM幻觉问题和类别不平衡问题，在社交媒体数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习方法在MBTI人格预测中存在局限性，而大语言模型虽然具有潜力，但面临幻觉问题和MBTI类型自然分布不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出PostToPersonality框架：1）利用检索增强生成和上下文学习缓解LLM幻觉；2）通过合成少数类过采样技术平衡类别分布；3）对预训练LLM进行微调以提高MBTI理解能力。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个机器学习和深度学习基线方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效解决了LLM在MBTI预测中的幻觉和类别不平衡问题，为社交媒体人格分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [8] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5在生物医学NLP基准测试中表现最佳，在问答任务上超越监督SOTA，但在抽取和摘要任务上仍落后于领域特定模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物医学文献的快速增长，需要评估通用大语言模型在生物医学NLP任务上的性能，为系统设计提供指导

Method: 使用标准化的BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o的零样本、单样本和五样本提示性能，涵盖命名实体识别、关系抽取、文档分类、问答、摘要和文本简化等6类任务

Result: GPT-5在五样本提示下获得0.557的宏平均分，优于GPT-4(0.506)和GPT-4o(0.508)。在MedQA上达到94.1%准确率，超越监督SOTA 50多个点；在PubMedQA上与监督系统持平；在化学NER和ChemProt关系抽取上表现优异，但摘要和疾病NER仍落后于领域基线

Conclusion: GPT-5已成为通用模型，在推理型生物医学问答任务上达到部署就绪水平，但精确度要求高的抽取和证据密集的摘要任务仍需微调或混合方法，需要检索增强或规划框架

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

### [9] [Can Multiple Responses from an LLM Reveal the Sources of Its Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04464)
*Yang Nan,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于诊断大语言模型不确定性源头的框架，通过分析多个生成响应的分歧模式来识别不确定性是来自输入问题的模糊性还是知识缺口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多研究关注量化模型不确定性，但很少工作深入研究不确定性的源头诊断，而这对提高LLM在实际应用中的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个响应，然后使用辅助LLM分析这些响应的分歧模式，识别不确定性的源头（输入模糊性、知识缺口或二者关联），并在知识缺口情况下识别具体缺少的事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的通用性，能够有效诊断不同类型的不确定性源头。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性源头诊断方法具有潜力，可以通过相关的人工干预来提高LLM的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究自动文本情感识别在争议解决中的作用，发现大语言模型比传统方法在情感强度标注方面表现更好，能够解释情感表达如何影响冲突升级和解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在争议解决背景下，自动文本情感识别是否能提供对情感表达如何影响对方思想、情感和行动的洞察。争议比谈判引发更强烈的情感和不同的社会过程。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，研究情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果。比较大语言模型与传统方法在情感强度标注方面的表现。

Result: 大语言模型在情感强度标注方面比先前方法具有显著更大的解释力，更符合人类标注者的决策。研究结果支持现有关于情感表达如何促进冲突升级和解决的理论模型。

Conclusion: 基于代理的系统可以通过识别和可能缓解情绪升级来有效管理争议，自动情感识别技术在争议解决中具有实用价值。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型中可迁移任务表征的形成时机和演化方式，发现这些表征以非单调、局部化的方式形成，仅在特定token处出现，并倾向于捕获最小化的"任务范围"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在上下文学习过程中，新任务表征何时形成以及如何随时间变化，特别是研究可迁移的任务表征特性。

Method: 通过分析语言模型中"可迁移"任务表征（能在其他模型实例中恢复任务上下文的向量表示），研究其在上下文序列中的形成和演化模式。

Result: 发现任务表征以非单调、零星的方式演化，仅在特定token处形成，具有强烈的时间局部性和语义局部性，倾向于捕获最小任务范围。

Conclusion: 语言模型采用一种即时计算过程来适应新证据和学习新任务，这种双重局部性（时间和语义）是其上下文学习能力的基础。

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

TL;DR: 一种专门为预填解码分离推理设计的剪枝方法，通过迭代块移除和转寄设置优化模型，并使用标记感知KV缓存剪枝降低通信成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时高计算和内存成本问题，现有剪枝方法忽视了实际应用中预填解码分离的特性

Method: 构建剪枝和转寄设置，进行迭代块移除，并使用标记感知KV缓存剪枝机制选择性重用关键值缓存

Result: 在PD分离和统一设置下都获得了良好性能，推理速度提升20.56%，数据传输带宽消耗降低4.95倍

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效降低LLM部署成本，同时保持良好的性能表现，为大模型高效部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次对CFA三级考试的1560道选择题进行系统评估，比较了多模态、推理专用和轻量级三类LLM在零样本提示和RAG管道下的表现，发现推理导向模型在零样本设置中表现最佳，RAG显著提升复杂场景准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融领域应用潜力巨大，但缺乏针对专业金融场景的系统性评估，特别是CFA这种全球最严格的金融认证考试。

Method: 使用CFA I-III级官方模拟考试的1560道选择题，比较三类LLM：多模态计算型、推理专用高精度型和轻量效率优化型。采用零样本提示和创新的RAG管道，通过分层知识组织和结构化查询生成实现精确领域知识检索。

Result: 推理导向模型在零样本设置中表现最优，RAG管道对复杂场景提供显著改进。错误分析显示知识差距是主要失败原因，文本可读性影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究为金融领域LLM部署提供了实用指导，为从业者提供了基于证据的模型选择和成本效益优化建议。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

*Swarnadeep Bhar,Omar Naim,Eleni Metheniti,Bastien Navarri,Loïc Cabannes,Morteza Ezzabady,Nicholas Asher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COCORELI是一个混合智能体框架，通过整合中等规模LLM代理、新颖的抽象机制和话语模块，解决了大型语言模型在复杂指令遵循、减少幻觉和空间推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂指令执行、减少幻觉和空间推理任务中的局限性，提升模型在协作构建等实际任务中的表现。

Method: 整合中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖的抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，通过上下文学习动态生成环境的高级表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中，COCORELI超越了使用更大LLM的单LLM CoT和代理LLM系统，能够有效避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习对象。在ToolBench API完成任务中也展示了其抽象能力。

Conclusion: COCORELI框架通过混合方法和抽象机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现，特别是在减少幻觉和空间推理方面表现出色，其能力可扩展到环境之外的其他领域。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

### [16] [MOSAIC: A Multilingual, Taxonomy-Agnostic, and Computationally Efficient Approach for Radiological Report Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04471)
*Alice Schiavone,Marco Fraccaro,Lea Marie Pehrson,Silvia Ingala,Rasmus Bonnevie,Michael Bachmann Nielsen,Vincent Beliveau,Melanie Ganz,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个基于开源语言模型MedGemma-4B的多语言放射学报告分类系统，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量级微调，在多个数据集上达到接近专家水平的性能，且计算资源需求低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告分类方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以处理语言变异性，监督模型需要大量标注数据，基于LLM的系统依赖闭源或资源密集型模型，且大多仅限于英语和单一模态/分类体系。

Method: 基于紧凑的开源语言模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量级微调，可在消费级GPU上部署，支持多语言、多模态和多分类体系。

Result: 在7个数据集（英语、西班牙语、法语、丹麦语）上评估，平均宏F1分数达88分（5个胸部X光数据集），接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。数据增强后，仅80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82加权F1分数。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区在新语言、分类体系和模态上评估和扩展。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

*Kushan Mitra,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，将模糊的用户对话重写为简洁的目标表示，以提高多智能体对话系统的规划效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界对话往往存在模糊性、不完整性和动态变化，传统分类方法在开放域设置中泛化能力差，导致意图识别困难和下游规划效果不佳。

Method: 提出RECAP基准数据集，包含模糊性、意图漂移、模糊性和多目标对话等挑战；开发基于LLM的评估器评估规划效用；采用提示工程和DPO微调两种重写方法。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，DPO微调的两种重写器进一步提升了效用增益，证明了意图重写对改善开放域对话系统规划的有效性。

Conclusion: 意图重写是改善开放域对话系统中智能体规划的关键且可行的组件，RECAP基准为这一领域的研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Motivation: 语音编码器与LLM集成需要大量数据和资源，但实际应用中数据可用性不足，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 使用参数高效的适配器转换语音嵌入，采用LLM合成数据集标注技术减少标注成本，并引入分类器正则化和LoRA优化技术。

Result: 在LibriSpeech ASR任务上相对WER提升26%，NER任务F1分数相对提升6.3%，SA任务F1分数相对提升32%，SLUE评分提升6.6%和9.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的适配器方法使用7倍更少的可训练参数，实现了显著的性能提升，为语音与LLM集成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个第一个综合性的指导性解码基准测试，用于加速大语言模型的测试时扩展推理能力，发现简单的n-gram方法在处理重复推理模式方面有独特优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展技术存在计算效率低下的问题，产生了大量冗余和重复的推理追踪，导致显著的计算开销。需要研究指导性解码在结构化、重复性强的测试时扩展环境中的效果。

Method: 构建了一个综合性基准测试，包含一致的实验协议和代表性的测试时扩展范式，如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考。对比了三类主要指导性解码方法：模型基于、训练基于和n-gram基于方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，简单的n-gram基于方法能够有效捕捉重复模式，在加速测试时扩展方面展现出独特潜力。这为整合n-gram基于方法与模型基于或训练基于方法提供了价值，以平衡重复和多样化推理的加速需求。

Conclusion: 这个基准测试有助于推动指导性解码在测试时扩展领域的进一步研究，通过更好地处理重复和多样化的推理路径，实现更快速、更实用的大语言模型推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParaThinker通过并行生成多条推理路径来克服大型语言模型中的"隧道视觉"问题，相比顺序推理在计算效率上更优，小模型也能达到大模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型通过增加计算长度来提升推理能力，但这种方法存在边际效益递减的瓶颈，即"隧道视觉"问题 - 模型不完美的初始步骤会锁定在次优推理路径上

Method: 提出ParaThinker框架，训练LLM并行生成多个不同的推理路径，然后综合这些路径得出更优的最终答案，实现原生思维并行化

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中，ParaThinker相比顺序LLM实现了显著准确率提升（1.5B模型平均提升12.3%，7B模型平均提升7.5%，使用8条并行路径），同时仅增加7.1%的延迟开销

Conclusion: 并行计算（宽度扩展）比顺序计算（深度扩展）是更有效和高效的推理扩展方式，小模型可以通过并行思维超越更大模型，为未来LLM扩展提供了关键的高效维度

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

TL;DR: CAMT5是一种新颖的文本到分子模型，通过引入子结构级标记化和基于重要性的训练策略，解决了现有原子级标记化方法在捕捉分子全局结构上下文方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到分子模型使用原子级标记化，主要关注局部连接性，限制了模型捕捉分子全局结构上下文的能力。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够更好地理解分子语义的模型。

Method: 提出了Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5)模型，引入子结构级标记化方案，并开发了基于重要性的训练策略，优先处理关键子结构。还提出了简单的集成策略来聚合多个模型的输出。

Result: 实验证明CAMT5在各种文本到分子生成任务中表现优越，仅使用2%的训练标记就能超越最先进方法。集成策略进一步提升了生成性能。

Conclusion: CAMT5通过子结构级标记化和重要性训练策略，显著提升了文本到分子模型的性能，证明了捕捉分子全局结构上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at
https://github.com/Songhyeontae/CAMT5.git.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型通过分布式、训练驱动的分化而非模块化架构来实现稀有词元的专业化处理，形成双计算机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词元预测方面存在困难，但此前对稀有词元处理机制的专业化机制尚不清楚，特别是对"高原神经元"的功能组织缺乏了解

Method: 在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类分析和注意力头消融实验

Result: 1) 稀有词元处理需要额外的"高原神经元"，形成双计算机制；2) 高原神经元在空间上分布而非形成模块化集群；3) 注意力机制没有优先路由到专家神经元

Conclusion: 稀有词元的专业化是通过分布式、训练驱动的分化实现的，而非架构模块化，这样既保持了上下文敏感的灵活性，又实现了自适应容量分配

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Conclusion: 通过离散提示微调方法，有效解决了MLLMs在个人化视觉情感识别中的偏向性问题，为实际应用提供了关键技术支撑

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如女性健康）中，检索增强生成系统的可靠拒绝机制至关重要，错误答案可能导致严重危害

Method: 使用基于能量模型学习260万指南衍生问题的平滑能量景观，与校准softmax基线和k近邻密度启发式方法进行对比

Result: EBM在语义困难案例中达到AUROC 0.961（softmax为0.950），FPR@95降低至0.235（softmax为0.331），在安全关键困难分布中优势最明显

Conclusion: 基于能量的拒绝评分比基于概率的softmax置信度提供更可靠的置信信号，为安全RAG系统提供了可扩展和可解释的基础

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注声明分解的生成方法，但对分解后原子声明质量的评估关注不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入三个新指标（COMPLETENESS、CORRECTNESS、SEMANTIC ENTROPY）作为奖励函数，优化轻量级声明分解模型的性能。

Result: 通过自动评估为声明分解设定了基准，提高了事实核查系统的可靠性和有效性。

Conclusion: DecMetrics指标能够有效评估声明分解质量，为事实核查系统提供了重要的质量保证机制。

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用序列化输出提示(SOP)的方法来改善基于大语言模型(LLM)的多讲者语音识别系统性能。通过结构化提示和三阶段训练策略，在两人和三人对话场景中都显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基于多讲者ASR系统要么省略提示要么使用简单的任务定义提示，没有研究如何设计提示来提高系统性能。这篇论文的动机是通过插入序列化输出提示(SOP)来显式引导LLM，以改善多讲者语音识别的性能。

Method: 提出SOP-MT-ASR方法：1)在语音编码器后插入分离器和序列化CTC层，按先说先出的方式分离和提取多讲者内容；2)通过贪婪搜索解码序列化CTC输出获得SOP提示；3)设计三阶段训练策略：序列化输出训练(SOT)精调、序列化语音信息提取、SOP基于适配。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验结果显示：LLM基于SOT模型在两人对话场景中表现良好，但在更复杂的三人对话场景中无法充分利用LLM。提出的SOP方法在两人和三人条件下都显著提高了系统性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用结构化的序列化输出提示(SOP)来显式引导大语言模型，可以有效改善多讲者语音识别系统的性能，尤其是在更复杂的多人对话场景中。这为LLM基于ASR系统的提示设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用电视字幕作为上下文提示的弱监督ASR方法，通过迭代优化生成伪转录本，显著提高了转录准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视字幕虽然容易获取，但与音频对齐不精确，不能直接作为监督信号。需要一种方法来处理口语音频和字幕文本之间的差异

Method: 将字幕重新构想为上下文丰富的提示，生成伪转录本作为主要目标，字幕作为迭代优化的指导线索。引入加权注意力机制在推理过程中强调相关字幕词元

Result: 实验证明转录准确性显著提升，生成的伪标注数据集为训练鲁棒ASR系统提供了高质量基础资源

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了电视字幕与音频对齐不精确的问题，通过弱监督框架成功提升了ASR系统的性能

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于单次生成序列中top token对数概率的幻觉检测方法，适用于黑盒LLM API场景，无需多次查询即可有效检测问答任务中的幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在问答任务中的幻觉问题严重影响了实际应用的可靠性，特别是在只能访问有限数据（如黑盒API仅提供少量top token对数概率）的场景下需要有效的检测方法

Method: 从非贪婪解码过程中可用的top token对数概率推导不确定性指标，首先提出熵产生率(EPR)基准指标，然后通过监督学习增强，使用单次生成序列中可访问top token的熵贡献特征

Result: 在多个问答数据集和LLM上的评估显示，该方法相比单独使用EPR显著提升了幻觉检测性能，仅使用少量top token对数概率（如top<10）就能实现高性能

Conclusion: 该方法为QA和RAG系统提供了一种即插即用的技术，通过单次生成即可增强LLM响应的可信度，在金融框架分析年报查询的工业数据集中也证明了其实用性

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: 通过分析ICU出院摘要的临床故事，结合BioBERT情感嵌入、词法压力词典和LDA主题模型，构建了一个预测医务人员熬燾的混合模型，效果显著超过仅使用元数据的基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生熬燾对ICU患者安全构成严重威胁，现有研究多依赖回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床故亊中的价值信息。

Method: 分析MIMIC-IV数据库中10,000份ICU出院摘要，使用混合流水线：细调BioBERT情感嵌入、专门的词法压力词典、5个主题的LDA模型以及工作负荷代理指标，最终通过逻辑回归分类器进行预测。

Result: 在分层预留集上达到预精度0.80、召回率0.89、F1分数0.84，比仅用元数据的基准模型提升0.17以上。发现放射科、精神科和神经科医生的熬燾风险较高。

Conclusion: ICU临床故亊中含有可行动的信号，可用于主动的医务人员健康监测，为预防性健康管理提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现开源大语言模型在大学推荐中存在地理、人口和经济偏见，全球北方院校被过度推荐，存在性别刻板印象和机构重复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛用于教育规划等推荐任务，需要评估其推荐是否会产生社会偏见，确保高等教育推荐的公平性。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户配置文件（不同性别、国籍和经济状况），分析三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B、Mistral-7B）的25,000多条大学和专业推荐，并提出多维度评估框架。

Result: 结果显示强烈偏见：全球北方院校被过度偏爱，推荐中存在性别刻板印象，机构重复现象普遍。LLaMA-3.1多样性最高但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在教育大语言模型中考虑偏见的紧迫性，需要确保全球高等教育的公平获取，提出了超越准确度的多维度评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户经常遇到生成式搜索系统的过度自信、弱来源支持和混乱的引用实践问题，需要系统化的评估框架来改进这些系统的可信度。

Method: 使用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）构建引用和事实支持矩阵，通过自动化提取管道评估主流公共模型，并采用与人类评分者验证一致的LLM-judge进行评估。

Result: 研究发现生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理经常在辩论查询中产生片面且高度自信的回应，包含大量未得到来源支持的陈述。深度研究配置虽然减少了过度自信，但在辩论查询中仍然高度片面，引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 当前生成式搜索系统在证据推理和归因方面存在显著缺陷，需要更严格的审计框架来提升系统的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时存在脆弱性，倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，少量不相关内容即可显著降低回答质量。研究提出Poisoned Context测试平台和基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过两阶段微调使模型能够识别并忽略不适当信号，提升39.8%的回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界上下文往往混合相关和不相关内容，LLMs在处理这种混合上下文时存在可靠性风险，需要研究LLMs如何处理和优先考虑混合上下文信息。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context测试平台，将查询与包含相关和不相关内容的真实上下文配对。基于神经科学的Rescorla-Wagner模型量化竞争性上下文信号对LLM输出的影响。提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法，使模型能够内部识别和忽略不适当信号。

Result: 发现LLMs存在一致的行为模式：强烈倾向于采纳上下文中较少出现的信息。少量不相关内容即可显著降低回答质量。RW-Steering方法在实验中提升回答质量39.8%，并逆转了不良行为曲线。

Conclusion: RW-Steering作为一种稳健、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案，能够有效提高LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性，无需依赖对多样化上下文混合的大量监督即可实现稳健泛化。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Motivation: 现有对指令微调算法的解释往往假设前提知识、缺乏关键细节或过于抽象复杂，需要一个更加清晰直观的从头开始的教学式讲解。

Method: 使用简化和明确的表示法，专注于大语言模型，逐步讨论和提炼各种算法，避免多余的抽象化和认知负担。

Result: 提供了一个完整的指令微调算法体系的清晰解释，包含了从基础到先进的各种方法，并展望了新的研究方向。

Conclusion: 该论文为指令微调领域提供了一个系统化的教学式资源，通过简化表达和直接联系大语言模型特性，使得复杂算法更易理解，并为未来研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy
Evolution) are presented.

Result: 在VaccineRAG上的综合评估和消融研究验证了所提方案的有效性。

Conclusion: VaccineRAG能够系统性地暴露当前LLMs的固有弱点，并增强其样本判别和复杂思维链学习能力，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试主要关注性能指标，无法捕捉模型间的细微行为差异。需要开发新方法来识别和理解不同模型的内在行为特征。

Method: 使用精心设计的诊断提示套件和自动化评估流程，让强大的LLM作为公正评判者，分析18个不同能力层级的模型。

Result: 发现LLM领域存在关键分歧：顶级模型在抽象和因果推理等核心能力上趋同，但在奉承行为和语义鲁棒性等对齐相关行为上差异巨大。还观察到跨模型的默认人格聚类现象。

Conclusion: 模型的交互性质并非其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果。该框架为揭示这些深层行为差异提供了可重复和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出BAME方法，通过模型生成的解释来指导提示工程，有效减少AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，在25个职业群体和3个大语言模型上实现了2%-20%的偏见改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面。本文旨在调查AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，并提出有效的缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME（Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation）方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导有针对性的提示工程，在不修改模型参数的情况下减少偏见。在25个职业群体、3个大语言模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Llama 3.1 70B Instruct、GPT-4 Turbo）和多个人口统计维度上进行分析。

Result: 应用BAME方法后，人口统计表征偏见改善了2%到20%。研究发现训练数据刻板印象导致的持续过度表征和不足表征模式。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型使用其内部推理机制，可以显著提高人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比单语言BERT模型的性能，证明尽管进行高质量翻译，本土语言训练的模型仍然比通过翻译在其他语言模型上评估的性能更好，错误率相差近四倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考察大语言模型在不同语言间的性能平等性问题，识别英语在训练数据中的主导地位可能对非英语用户造成不利影响。

Method: 采用对比实验设计：一个全部在斯瓦希里语新闻数据上训练和测试的单语言BERT模型，与另一个在相似英语数据上训练的模型进行比较。将斯瓦希里语数据翻译成英语后用英语模型评估。

Result: 本土斯瓦希里语训练的模型表现明显更优，错误率仅为0.36%，而通过翻译在英语模型上评估的方式错误率达到1.47%，相差近四倍。

Conclusion: 翻译不能完全消除语言间的表征差异，本土语言训练对于获得可靠结果仍然至关重要。应重点关注低代表性语言的数据集开发和多语言模型评估，以减少AI部署对现有数字氛沟的加剧作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习（GRPO方法）提升小型语言模型在工具使用方面的能力，解决SLMs相比LLMs在工具使用上的性能差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但计算资源需求高。小型语言模型虽然更紧凑高效，但在工具使用能力上明显不足，需要提升其实用性

Method: 采用强化学习方法，特别是Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术，对小型语言模型进行优化训练

Result: 该方法显著提高了小型语言模型的工具使用准确率，增强了其实际应用价值

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习方法为小型语言模型提供了一种高效有效的工具使用能力提升方案，相比传统微调方法更具适应性和计算效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

Motivation: 从放射学报告中提取结构化临床信息具有挑战性，特别是在低资源语言和克罗恩病这种多器官发现的稀疏表示情况下

Method: 基于提示的HSMP-BERT模型，使用分层结构化匹配预测方法，在9,683份希伯来语放射学报告上进行训练和测试

Result: 在24个器官-发现组合上平均F1得分0.83±0.08，Cohen's κ 0.65±0.17，显著优于基线方法，分层推理将运行时间减少5.1倍

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展解决方案，支持克罗恩病的群体水平分析，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 哨利亚长期武装冲突但缺乏系统性暴力记录，导致公开冲突信息和历史记述的缺失，需要构建历史记忆。

Method: 使用GPT大语言模型阅读和回答关于20万份西班牙语暴力相关报纸文章的问题，构建数据集并进行描述性分析和因果关系研究。

Result: 创建了大规模冲突数据集，并通过具体案例(暴力与古印笋植植清除关系)展示了该数据在政策分析中的应用价值。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为研究大规模文本语料提供了前所未有的深度分析能力，开启了新的研究可能性。

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Conclusion: 量化为在生物医学环境中安全、本地部署大型高容量语言模型提供了实用有效的策略，弥合了AI技术进步与实际临床转化之间的差距

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Motivation: 虽然基于Transformer的语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色，但细粒度控制仍然具有挑战性。需要开发系统性的方法来精确操控模型行为，同时确保鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 将可控文本生成形式化为优化问题，采用提示工程、参数高效微调、模型编辑和强化学习等方法。提出了包含提示层引导、激活干预和权重空间编辑的统一框架。

Result: 理论上证明最小权重更新即可实现目标行为改变且副作用有限。实证显示在情感控制和事实编辑方面成功率超过90%，同时保持了基础性能，但存在泛化与特异性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为设计可控且鲁棒的语言模型奠定了基础，同时讨论了伦理双重使用风险，强调需要进行严格评估。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谬刺作为人类交陆的常见特征，在人际交往和人机交互中带来挑战。虽然之前研究主要集中在文本基础的谬刺检测，但语音数据在识别谬刺中的作用被忽视。语音技术的进步强调了利用语音数据进行自动谬刺识别的日益重要性，这可以为神经退行性疾病患者提升社交交往能力，并改善机器对复杂人类语言使用的理解。

Conclusion: 谬刺应被视为一种多模态现象，而非单纯的文本基础挑战。未来研究需要更多关注跨文化和多语言谬刺识别，并重视谬刺作为多模态现象的处理方式。

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

TL;DR: 提出SEMI方法，通过超网络适配器实现样本高效的多模态集成，仅需少量样本即可将新模态集成到大型语言模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，现有方法需要大量配对数据，而低资源模态往往缺乏这样的数据

Method: 设计超网络来适配共享投影器，该投影器位于模态特定编码器和LLM之间。超网络在文本、语音、音频、视频等高资源模态上训练，推理时通过任意模态的少量样本生成合适的适配器。通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性

Result: SEMI在新模态集成中显著提升样本效率，相比从头训练投影器需要64倍数据才能达到相同准确率，在卫星图像、天文图像、惯性测量和分子等模态上表现优异

Conclusion: SEMI有望扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态集成提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

Motivation: 社交媒体在灾难应急中成为重要信息源，但传统ML模型无法充分理解非正式、隐喻性和模糊的语言上下文，需要更先进的模型来提高分类准确性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa）与传统ML模型（逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯、支持向量机）进行对比实验，评估灾难相关推文分类效果。

Result: BERT模型表现最佳，达到91%的准确率，显著优于传统模型的82%。Transformer模型通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制能更好地理解推文中的微妙语言。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在公共安全应用中远优于传统方法，提供更高的准确性、更深的语言理解和更好的泛化能力，特别适合处理真实世界的社交媒体文本。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

Conclusion: 该方法通过dropout容忍度有效区分领域内外输入，为专业LLM提供了具有理论保障的安全检测方案

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

TL;DR: 阿拉伯语语言模型幻觉评估研究，通过12个细粒度指标评估了四类12个LLM在生成式问答和摘要任务中的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语在全球范围内广泛使用，但LLM在阿拉伯语环境下的幻觉问题研究相对缺乏，需要建立维度全面的评估框架

Method: 开发了12个细粒度幻觉评估指标的框架，评估了4个阿拉伯语预训练模型、4个多语言模型和4个推理基础模型在生成式问答和摘要任务中的表现

Result: 事实性幻觉比忠实性错误更常见；阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam在幻觉率方面表现更优于多语言模型，与推理基础模型相当

Conclusion: 研究填补了阿拉伯语LLM幻觉评估的空白，为多语言模型的幻觉问题提供了重要见解，并开源了评估框架

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模型评估框架，通过SQL2NL自动生成语义等价的语言变体来系统性地测试NL2SQL模型的语言变化验证能力，发现当前最优模型在语言变化下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL模型评测标准缺乏对语言变化的系统性考察，无法真正评估模型在实际应用中的演绎性和通用性能力。

Method: 设计了一种模板对齐的重写框架，利用SQL2NL技术自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询语句，同时保持与原始模板和意图的一致性。

Result: 当前最优模型在语言变化下性能显著下降：LLaMa3.3-70B执行准确率下降10.23%（从77.11%降至66.9%），LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%（从62.9%降至42.5%），较小模型受影响更大。验证性能下降程度会随查询复杂度、数据集和领域而异。

Conclusion: 当前NL2SQL模型对语言变化的验证能力远低于标准测试的表现，强调需要开发专门测量语言通用性的评估框架，以确保模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 语言模型的幻觉问题来源于训练和评估流程中对猜测的奖励，而非承认不确定性，需要通过修改现有评测标准来缓解

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在不确定时猜测而产生错误声明的幻觉问题，提高AI系统的可信赖性

Method: 分析现代训练流程中幻觉的统计根源，识别二元分类错误的起因，并提出修改评测标准的社会技术缓解方案

Result: 幻觉问题并非神秘现象，而是由于训练和评估中对猜测行为的奖励机制导致的自然统计压力

Conclusion: 需要通过修改现有评测标准来减少对不确定回答的惩罚，从而引导领域向更可信赖的AI系统发展

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with

lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在准确回答复杂问题方面面临挑战，需要探索有效的方法来提升模型的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用多跳问题分解方法，将MQUAKE-T数据集分为单跳和多跳两种格式，使用LoRA方法对LLAMA3模型进行微调，并比较不同方法的性能表现。

Result: 未微调时，多跳分解方法的预测性能显著优于直接回答方法；微调后两种方法性能均有提升，但多跳分解方法始终保持优势。

Conclusion: 多跳问题分解方法在训练前后都能有效提升LLM回答复杂问题的能力，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Motivation: 现有的监督微调和强化学习方法虽然能提升模型性能，但会降低输出多样性，导致响应过于单一和规范化

Method: 基于行列式点过程(DPPs)，对每个提示采样一组响应并嵌入，通过核相似矩阵的行列式来测量嵌入向量的体积跨度，从而量化语义多样性

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的情况下显著提高了语义多样性

Conclusion: DQO方法有效解决了LLM后训练中的多样性损失问题，为同时优化质量和多样性提供了新途径

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Result: 数据增帽能够提升分类性能，而在增帽数据集上进行继续预训练反而可能引入噪声并降低准确性。分类头的修改仅带来边际改善。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指南，并为短文本情感分类策略的精炼提供了见解。数据增帽是有效的方法，而预训练需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统研究了大语言模型中人格操控的机制和权衡，比较了三种方法：上下文学习、参数高效微调和机制导向，并提出了统一评估框架和稳定性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在客服和自主代理场景中应用日渐增多，人格操控的机制和权衡仍不明确，需要系统研究不同方法的效果和特性。

Method: 使用Big Five人格特质构建对比数据集，比较三种方法：上下文学习(ICL)、参数高效微调(PEFT)和机制导向(MS)。提出统一评估框架、特质粹净技术和三级稳定性分析框架。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2B-IT和LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型上实验：ICL实现强对齐且能力损失最小；PEFT对齐效果最好但任务性能下降；MS提供轻量运行控制且效果竞争力强。开放性特质最难操控，和谐性对ICL抗性最强。

Conclusion: 人格操控是行为表征的多层次探针，机制导向方法作为轻量替代方案，在部署和可解释性方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 解决会话AI中服务回复生成的核心问题：显式意图识别是否是生成高质量服务回复的先决条件，还是模型可以直接生成有效回复。

Method: 使用两个公开服务交互数据集，对比多个状态上的语言模型（包括精调的T5变体）在两种范式下的表现：意图先行回复生成和直接回复生成。

Result: 评估指标包括语言质量和任务成功率，结果揭示了关于显式意图建模必要性或冗余性的惊人见解，挖成传统观点。

Conclusion: 研究结果挖成了会话AI流水线中的传统假设，为设计更高效和有效的回复生成系统提供了可操作的指导方针。

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective
response generation systems.

Motivation: 因人类写作内容稀缺，大语言模型越来越依赖合成数据，但递归训练导致模型崩溃，威胁事实可靠性。

Method: 通过控制实验进行递归合成训练，分析指令格式对崩溃轨迹的影响，提出领域特定合成训练作为缓解策略。

Result: 崩溃轨迹和时机严重依赖于指令格式，领域特定合成训练在保持计算效率的同时实现了崩溃耐受性的显著改善。

Conclusion: 研究提供了崩溃动力学的理论见解和可持续AI训练的实践指南，尤其在准确性至关重要的知识密集型应用中。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个标准化的基准测试，用于评估时间序列-语言模型在三个自然语言描述任务上的性能，发现现有方法存在明显不足且鲁棒性较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型评估存在两个主要问题：1）不同研究使用不同数据集，难以进行直接比较；2）评估覆盖过多任务，无法明确具体能力对性能的贡献。需要专门针对时间序列自然语言描述能力进行标准化评估。

Method: 形式化定义了三个时间序列自然语言描述任务：识别（真/假问答）、区分（多选题问答）和生成（开放式自然语言描述）。统一了4个现有数据集，评估了13个最先进的语言模型、视觉-语言模型和时间序列-语言模型。

Result: 1）纯语言方法表现不佳，需要时间序列专用架构；2）视觉-语言模型表现良好，证实视觉模型的价值；3）预训练多模态时间序列-语言模型优于纯语言模型，但仍有改进空间；4）所有方法在鲁棒性测试中都表现出明显的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为时间序列推理系统提供了必要的标准化评估框架，揭示了当前方法在时间序列自然语言描述任务上的局限性，特别是鲁棒性方面的不足，为未来研究指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估AI代理在部署环境中的安全风险，揭示了传统模型级评估无法发现的代理特有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，现有安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要专门的代理情境评估方法。

Method: 通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击对GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash进行跨模型验证。

Result: 发现代理特有漏洞（工具调用攻击成功率提高24-60%），揭示通用代理模式、最高风险工具、语义漏洞机制和上下文依赖的攻击有效性。

Conclusion: 研究确立了代理情境评估范式的迫切需求，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证，填补了系统评估空白。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但仍然容易受到虚假的概念驱动相关性影响，这会损害模型的鲁棒性和公平性

Method: 首先通过内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关表示，然后使用可控去偏模块通过对比学习精细调整剩余概念线索的影响

Result: 在IMDB和Yelp数据集上使用三种预训练架构进行评估，CURE在IMDB上实现了F1分数+10的绝对提升，在Yelp上实现了+2的提升，同时计算开销最小

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗概念偏见建立了一个灵活的无监督蓝图，为更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

TL;DR: 研究表明判别词典模型(DLM)可以在不设置屈折类别的情况下学习和生成芬兰语名词屈折变化，模型性能与屈折类别的生产力相关，但在基于使用的模型中频率是主要预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确学习名词屈折变化，以及判别词典模型是否能在不设置屈折类别的情况下处理芬兰语名词屈折。

Method: 使用包含49个屈折类别、2000个高频芬兰语名词的55,271个屈折形式数据集，建立多个DLM理解和生成模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习模型和考虑词频的基于使用的学习模型。

Result: 模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据准确度下降但仍可接受。模型对生产力强的屈折类别表现更好，但对基于使用的生成模型，频率是性能的主要预测因子，与生产力的相关性较弱或不存在。

Conclusion: DLM可以在不预设屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折，模型性能反映了屈折类别的生产力特征，但在实际使用中词频比抽象的类别结构更具影响力。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

Method: 提出适配性特征蓄纳框架，使用踢余投影神经网络（RPNN）的动态适配器对齐异构特征空间，通过动态蓄纳系数（DDC）根据意图和槽位预测性能进行调节。

Result: 在中文ProSLU基准测试中达到最佳结果：意图准确率95.67%、槽位F1分92.02%、总体准确率85.50%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SLU系统的数据稀缺和计算负担问题，在保持高性能的同时实现了轻量化部署。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到特征的出现、维持和中断，方法具有架构无关性和可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练过程中的表征学习提供了更可解释和细粒度的分析途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

Result: 评估显示当前模型性能仍然严重受限，特别是在新任务中表现不佳

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了现有模型在复杂社交认知方面的关键差距，为未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型的法则性是来自于训练数据的简单记忆还是深层语义理解。

Method: 提出双视角评估框架：通过场景相关问题答题（模型输出视角）和探针内部表征中编码的场景元素-argument关联（内部表征视角）来评估模型的场景认知能力。

Result: 实验结果显示当前的大语言模型主要依赖表面记忆，无法在即使简单的情况下实现稳健的语义场景认知。

Conclusion: 这些发现曝露了大语言模型在语义理解方面的严重局限性，为提升其能力提供了认知见解。

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

Result: 实验结果表明ICR能在澄清-重写迭代过程中持续提升检索性能

Conclusion: ICR框架有效解决了多模糊表达问题，在两个流行数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

Motivation: 自动化ICD-10编码可以简化医疗专业人员工作，确保医院编码的一致性，提高统计和保险目的的效率

Method: 多步骤管道方法：先使用临床字典匹配明确的术语，然后用GPT-4.1通过上下文学习预测未匹配项目的ICD-10编码

Result: 在西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上达到类别F1 0.89和子类别F1 0.78；在希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上达到F1 0.85

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地实现多语言临床文本中ICD-10编码的自动分配，为医疗信息结构化提供了可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

### [84] [HoPE: Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding for Stable Long-Range Dependency Modeling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05218)
*Chang Dai,Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Di Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE是一种基于双曲几何的新型位置编码方法，通过洛伦兹旋转解决RoPE在长距离依赖建模中的振荡问题，实现注意力权重随距离单调衰减，在长序列任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法存在局限性：绝对位置编码难以外推到更长序列，相对位置编码如Alibi在极长上下文上性能下降，而广泛使用的RoPE存在振荡注意力模式，阻碍稳定的长距离依赖建模。

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码(HoPE)，利用双曲函数对token表示进行洛伦兹旋转。理论分析表明RoPE是该方法的一个特例。

Result: 在多个扩展序列基准测试的困惑度评估中，HoPE始终优于现有位置编码方法，表现出更强的长距离依赖表示和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HoPE通过几何重构从根本上解决了RoPE的振荡问题，强制注意力权重随token距离增加而单调衰减，显著提升了长序列建模性能。

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE-RL框架通过自适应约束增强奖励机制，解决了LLM长文本生成中高质量数据稀缺和粗粒度优化的问题，显著超越现有方法并在多个基准上优于GPT-4o


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM长文本生成方法存在两个主要问题：(1)过度依赖稀缺的高质量长文本响应数据进行监督微调或成对偏好奖励；(2)只关注粗粒度的质量优化维度，忽略了不同长文本生成场景的细粒度特性

Method: 提出ACE-RL框架：首先自动将指令分解为细粒度的自适应约束标准，然后设计基于约束满足度的奖励机制，最后使用强化学习指导模型生成高质量长文本

Result: 在WritingBench基准上分别超越现有SFT和RL基线20.70%和7.32%，最佳模型甚至超越GPT-4o达7.10%

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLM提供了更有效的训练范式，能够在多样化长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient
training for the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Our approach applies diffusion training
objectives to language modeling under strict data constraints, incorporating
frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens while
maintaining theoretical validity. We explore multiple noise scheduling
strategies, including two-mode approaches, and investigate different noise
weighting schemes within the NELBO objective. We evaluate our method on the
BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and
human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid
autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training
offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec是一种利用单语语言模型熵来生成跨语言表示的新框架，通过模型预测的不确定性来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，避免了传统类型学清单的特征稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的局限性，需要一种能够动态捕捉语言间结构相似性的新方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性：低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异，从而生成密集、非稀疏的语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP下游任务（如LinguAlchemy框架）中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，生成的嵌入具有适应性且无缺失值，在跨语言表示学习中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像内机器翻译研究主要基于合成数据，具有背景简单、字体单一、文本位置固定等局限性，无法充分反映真实世界条件，导致研究与实践之间存在显著差距。

Method: 构建了PRIM真实世界数据集，包含复杂背景、多种字体、多样文本位置的多语言翻译图像；提出了VisTrans端到端模型，分别处理视觉文本和背景信息，确保多语言翻译能力同时提升视觉质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisTrans模型相比其他模型在翻译质量和视觉效果方面都取得了更好的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建真实世界数据集和开发专用模型，推动了图像内多语言机器翻译在实用场景中的发展，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

Motivation: 开发支持多语言翻译特别是中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译的开源模型，解决多样化翻译场景需求，提升测试时性能。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：通用和MT导向的预训练建立基础能力，监督微调进行任务适配，强化学习和弱到强RL进行高级对齐。Chimera模型整合不同参数设置下的多个输出。

Result: 在同等参数规模的翻译专用模型和大多数SOTA大模型上显著优于，特别是在中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译任务上。WMT2025共享任务中31个语言对30个排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在多语言翻译特别是低资源语言翻译方面表现出色，证明了方法的有效性和模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

Motivation: 解决链式思维推理在简单问题上产生不必要冗长输出的问题，让模型能够根据问题难度动态调整思维深度。

Method: 通过精心筛选包含与问题难度成正比的链式思维追踪的数据进行后练，不需修改模型架构。结合监督细调整(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)方法。

Result: 数量指标和质量评估都证明模型能够学会"按比例思考"，SFT主要捐捕推理长度和格式模式，DPO保持推理准确性，两者结合能够减少推理长度同时维持或提高性能。

Conclusion: 模型可以通过简单的后练练习完成难度感知的动态推理，在不修改架构的情况下实现更高效的链式思维。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

Result: 复现了信息密度与that使用的关系，发现上下文词嵌入比传统动词子类化概率能更好解释补语连接词使用模式

Conclusion: 上下文词嵌入提供了更优称的信息密度测量，支持均匀信息密度假设在语言产出中的作用

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

Motivation: 研究线性复杂度序列模型中衰减机制的设计原则和最佳实践，为模型设计提供理论指导和实证依据。

Method: 通过系统分析衰减机制的四个关键维度（参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度、RoPE兼容性），在多种语言建模任务上进行大量实验验证。

Result: 发现衰减参数需要特定范围内的精细配置；参数共享不当会导致性能显著下降；向量衰减通常优于标量衰减；RoPE对大多数线性注意力机制无实际益处。

Conclusion: 线性复杂度序列模型的衰减机制设计需要精心考虑多个维度，参数配置和共享策略对性能影响显著，RoPE的兼容性价值有限。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人类监督

Conclusion: Q-SafeML通过适应量子系统独特表示约束的距离度量，为QML提供了有效的安全监控解决方案

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在测试任务上表现出强推理时自我改进能力的策略

Conclusion: ExIt方法能够训练出在推理时进行多步自我改进的LLM，迭代性能超越训练时的平均迭代深度

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Motivation: 传统学习方法需要大量训练样本，数据收集成本高，特别是当先验分布内涵维度高或需要高精度解时

Conclusion: 该适应性采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个定量框架来评估表征相似性度量方法区分不同模型家族的能力，通过多种分离性指标系统比较了RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表征相似性度量是神经科学和AI中的基本工具，但缺乏对不同模型家族间区分能力的系统比较。需要开发一个框架来评估这些度量方法在区分不同架构和训练机制模型时的判别能力。

Method: 引入基于信号检测理论的dprime、轮廓系数和ROC-AUC三种互补的分离性度量，系统评估常用相似性度量方法（包括RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配）在CNN、Vision Transformer、Swin Transformer、ConvNeXt等架构以及有监督vs自监督训练机制下的判别能力。

Result: 发现分离性随着度量方法施加更严格的配准约束而系统性增加。在基于映射的方法中，软匹配达到最高分离性，其次是Procrustes配准和线性预测性。非拟合方法如RSA也能在不同家族间产生强分离性。

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离性视角系统比较了相似性度量方法，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较中的度量选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Result: 证明了任何非平凡置信水平都会导致预测集大小指数增长，指数与样本数量线性相关且与条件熵成正比。分散度作为二阶项影响界限。在相同标签的特殊情况下，问题简化为假设检验问题，并提供了渐近最优置信预测器。

Conclusion: 转导共形预测中存在置信度与效率之间的基本权衡，预测集大小随置信要求呈指数增长，这一界限在理论上是紧的，为实际应用中的权衡选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Conclusion: Transformer表示演化可被解释为恢复最优分类特征的轨迹，这为注意力机制的数学理解提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化问题，假设平出风险函数满足Tsybakov噪声条件，并考虑损失函数梯度的高阶矩。论文提出了无需依赖Lipschitz常数的隐私保护算法，并给出了上下界的精确分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的差分隐私随机凸优化研究假设损失函数满足Lipschitz连续性，但实际问题中损失函数的Lipschitz常数可能极大或无界。论文重新考虑在Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度高阶矩有界的前提下的隐私优化问题。

Method: 论文首先考虑Lipschitz损失函数且θ≥2的情况，提出了(ε, δ)-差分隐私算法。然后扩展到θ≥θ̅>1的更一般情况，并在隐私预算ε较小时考虑非Lipschitz损失函数。同时进行了下界分析，证明了最优随机风险进阶。

Result: 对于Lipschitz情况，算法达到了不依赖Lipschitz常数的上界进阶：Σ̊((r̃₂ᵣ(1/√n + √d/nε))^(k-1/k))^(θ/(θ-1))。对于非Lipschitz情况，在ε较小时达到了Σ̊((r̃ᵣ(1/√n + √d/nε))^(k-1/k))^(θ/(θ-1))。下界分析显示这些进阶是最优的。

Conclusion: 论文在更一般的Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度高阶矩有界的假设下，提出了无需依赖Lipschitz常数的差分隐私优化算法，并证明了其最优性。这为处理梯度可能极大或无界的实际优化问题提供了更强活的隐私保护方案。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

Motivation: 闪烁现象是气候系统、生态系统、金融市场等复杂系统中韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁现象方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，通过在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，来识别闪烁模式。

Result: 尽管在简化的动力学系统上训练，模型能够泛化到各种随机系统，并可靠地检测真实数据集中的闪烁现象，包括睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代用指标。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别广泛动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对理想轨迹的高覆盖概率，解决了传统解码方法缺乏可证明覆盖保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search虽然能生成合理的候选集，但缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，且在搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求（特别是长尾序列）之间难以有效平衡。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，基于共形预测框架构建模型无关的解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为复杂推理任务提供了一种具有可证明覆盖保证的高效解码方案，特别适用于需要长尾序列的现实应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

*Jasmine Shone,Shaden Alshammari,Mark Hamilton,Zhening Li,William Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索替代统计散度和相似性核，系统性地发现新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得了优于现有方法的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现23种表示学习方法隐式最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索不同的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核（如基于距离的核）来替代KL散度和角度核。

Result: 在无监督聚类中修改PMI算法使用TV距离达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中使用TV和距离核优于标准方法；在降维中使用有界f-散度比SNE获得更好的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明在表示学习优化中，散度和相似性核的选择对性能至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer是一种新颖的时间序列预测架构，将经典VARMA统计模型的优势与现代交叉注意力Transformer相结合，通过VFE特征提取器和VE-atten注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的交叉注意力Transformer模型虽然高效，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。为了弥补这一差距，需要将经典时间序列分析的原理与现代深度学习框架相结合。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在补丁级别显式建模自回归（AR）和移动平均（MA）模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上进行大量实验，证明该模型始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计见解整合到现代深度学习框架中对时间序列预测的显著益处，能够同时捕捉全局长期依赖性和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够高效移除GNN模型中的敏感训练节点，保护敏感节点的隐私信息。这些发现有助于提升GNN模型的隐私安全性，为节点反学习领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Motivation: 深度强化学习模型在静态环境中表现良好，但在持续强化学习场景中容易发生灾难性遗忘，导致性能下降。受人类前额叶皮层决策机制启发，需要开发能够持续学习的RL框架

Method: 集成多样化DQN变体（具有不同价值函数），并设计仲裁控制机制，优先选择最近试验中误差较小的agent

Result: 在静态和持续环境中都表现出显著性能提升，实证证据显示仲裁控制对多样化DQN训练的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的ACED-DQN框架使RL智能体能够持续学习，灵感来源于人脑决策机制，为解决灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用双随机归一化方法来分离混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，从而更准确地诊断模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受到类别相似性（模型混淆两个类别的难易程度）和分布偏差（训练集和测试集的偏斜分布）的影响，难以区分两者的单独贡献。

Method: 引入使用迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行和列归一化的泛化，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构。

Result: 该方法能够分离错误来源，支持更有针对性的模型改进，并在模型的内部类别表示空间中提供了对归一化的几何解释。

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种更深入理解分类器行为的方法，通过分离混淆矩阵中的不同影响因素，实现了更准确的模型诊断。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

Motivation: 传统的MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果关系且偏向低频分量，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适配的神经ODE进行集成，利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法初始化训练。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，有效解决了传统PINNs的局限性，为复杂PDE问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Conclusion: 通过分析批归一化层对TTA稳定性的影响，提出了梯度感知和表示正则化的解决方案，有效防止了模型崩溃，提升了测试时自适应的稳定性和实用性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Motivation: 现有初始化方法如Glorot、He、正交矩阵等在深度网络中的表现不理想，理论假设的单位方差在深度网络中无法保持，需要从第一层到最后一层逐渐增加方差。

Method: 提出了一种新的初始化方法，能够灵活地增加网络的方差，并且充分利用每个层的深度信息和整体网络的深度信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在深度网络中表现更好，性能超过了现有的初始化方案。

Conclusion: 通过考虑每个层的深度信息并灵活控制网络方差的增长，可以实现更有效的深度网络初始化，提高网络性能。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Motivation: 为了解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)需要针对每个PDE问题单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的统一框架，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: 使用基于Swin Transformer的超网络，结合标记数据（通过制造解方法生成）和无标记数据（物理信息目标优化），将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs。引入迭代精化程序生成增量PINN集合。

Result: 在7个PINN文献基准问题上实现强零样本准确性，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代精化在6个基准上实现100倍L2损失提升。微调后收敛更快且误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础方法的潜力，显著提高了准确性并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Motivation: 许多数据集中的类别标签具有层次结构，虽然分类任务通常定义在特定层级，但训练时可以使用更细粒度的标签。现有经验表明细粒度训练可能提升性能，但缺乏系统性的研究来验证这一观察的普适性和探究其根本原因

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集进行研究，分析数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素对细粒度标签训练效果的影响

Result: 细粒度标签训练并不总是能提高分类准确率，其有效性关键取决于数据的几何结构及其与标签层次的关系。数据集大小和模型容量也显著影响细粒度标签是否能带来性能提升

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练策略的效果具有条件依赖性，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来评估是否采用这种训练方式

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Conclusion: 该方法完全兼容标准推理流水线，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage

*Jehad Jilan,Niranjana Naveen Nambiar,Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Alok Paranjape,Amr Youssef,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用可解释的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)来检测电力系统自动发电控制(AGC)中的虚假数据注入攻击(FDIA)，相比传统黑盒方法具有更好的可解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动发电控制(AGC)对电网稳定性至关重要，但容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击，如虚假数据注入攻击(FDIA)，这些攻击会扰乱系统稳定性且能逃避传统检测方法。现有方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)作为可解释的FDIA检测方法，能够提取符号方程，考虑系统非线性特性。KAN模型离线训练学习不同运行场景下AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，训练后可提取描述模型行为的符号公式。

Result: 提出的KAN模型实现了高达95.97%的FDIA检测率（初始模型）和95.9%的检测率（符号公式），且具有较低的误报率。

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC网络安全提供了可靠的方法，兼具高检测精度和良好的可解释性，优于大多数机器学习模型。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了7种主流深度强化学习算法的能耗、碳排放和经济成本，发现算法间能效差异显著，某些算法可在保持性能的同时减少24%能耗和68%碳排放与成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习计算需求快速增长，但其能耗、温室气体排放和经济成本尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性评估以推动可持续发展

Method: 使用Stable Baselines实现7种DRL算法（DQN、TRPO、A2C、ARS、PPO、RecurrentPPO、QR-DQN），在10个Atari游戏上进行百万步训练，实时测量功耗并计算能耗、CO2排放和电费成本

Result: 算法间能效差异显著：ARS比DQN节能24%；QR-DQN比RecurrentPPO减少68%碳排放和成本；存在学习性能、训练时间、能耗和成本之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 研究为开发节能环保的DRL实践提供了可行见解，建立了将可持续性考量纳入未来算法设计和评估的基础

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: SpikingBrain是一个受大脑启发的模型家族，通过线性/混合线性注意力架构、脉冲神经元和专用硬件优化，在非NVIDIA平台上实现了高效的长上下文训练和推理，性能媲美Transformer但计算效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主流Transformer模型在长序列处理时面临的二次计算复杂度和线性内存增长问题，以及在非NVIDIA平台上训练大型模型的稳定性和效率挑战。

Method: 采用线性/混合线性注意力架构配合自适应脉冲神经元；开发高效的基于转换的训练管道和专用脉冲编码框架；针对MetaX硬件定制训练框架、算子库和并行策略。

Result: 开发了7B和76B两个模型，在150B tokens上持续预训练后性能媲美开源Transformer基线；7B模型在400万token序列上首token生成速度提升100倍以上；训练稳定，MFU达23.4%；脉冲方案实现69.15%稀疏度。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了脑启发机制在推动下一代高效可扩展大模型设计方面的潜力，特别是在非NVIDIA平台上实现大规模LLM开发的可行性。

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算复杂性和检测可靠性之间取得平衡，适合实际部署，为数字图像司法鉴定提供了强大方法，推动了视觉司法技术的发展

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM在分布式优化中应用广泛但存在收敛慢和对超参数敏感的问题，需要更高效的自适应方法

Method: 将ADMM迭代表示为GNN消息传递，用GNN预测超参数，通过展开固定迭代次数进行端到端训练

Result: 数值实验表明学习版本相比标准ADMM在收敛速度和求解质量上都有显著提升

Conclusion: 通过GNN学习自适应超参数的方法有效解决了ADMM的收敛问题，同时保持了算法的收敛性质

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的个性化效用调优框架DRL-PUT，用于广告推荐系统中的多目标优化，相比传统人工调优显著提升了点击率指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工调优方法存在调优目标不明确、参数组合过多、缺乏个性化和季节性适应能力等问题，导致结果次优

Method: 将问题建模为强化学习任务，根据广告请求状态预测最优超参数；直接从在线服务日志中学习最优策略模型，避免估计价值函数

Result: 在线A/B测试显示，相比基线人工调优方法，DRL-PUT在处理段上点击率提升9.7%，长点击率提升7.7%

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架有效解决了广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，通过强化学习方法实现了更好的个性化效果和性能提升

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

TL;DR: STADI是一个针对异构多GPU环境的扩散模型推理加速框架，通过时空自适应调度机制，在时间维度减少较慢GPU的去噪步骤，在空间维度弹性分配图像块，实现了45%的延迟降低和更好的负载均衡。

Conclusion: STADI框架通过时空维度的自适应调度，有效解决了异构环境下扩散模型推理的负载不均衡问题，大幅提升了推理效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image
generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their
substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism
inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU
environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause
workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion
Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in
such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained
parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI
introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup
phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to
reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further
minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism
mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to
their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through
a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both
load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,
demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance
bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion
inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference
latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on
heterogeneous GPUs.

Conclusion: VoltanaLLM为可持续和智能的LLM服务铺平了道路，证明了通过精细化的阶段特定控制可以在保证服务质量的同时显著降低能耗。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving
the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

Abstract: We present a multi-GPU extension of the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)
pipeline for scientific visualization. Building on previous work that
demonstrated high-fidelity isosurface reconstruction using Gaussian primitives,
we incorporate a multi-GPU training backend adapted from Grendel-GS to enable
scalable processing of large datasets. By distributing optimization across
GPUs, our method improves training throughput and supports high-resolution
reconstructions that exceed single-GPU capacity. In our experiments, the system
achieves a 5.6X speedup on the Kingsnake dataset (4M Gaussians) using four GPUs
compared to a single-GPU baseline, and successfully trains the Miranda dataset
(18M Gaussians) that is an infeasible task on a single A100 GPU. This work lays
the groundwork for integrating 3D-GS into HPC-based scientific workflows,
enabling real-time post hoc and in situ visualization of complex simulations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show best-in-class performance across a wide
range of natural language processing applications. Training these models is an
extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing
infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive
datasets. Unfortunately, information about the scaling performance and training
considerations of these large training pipelines is scarce in public
literature. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and
practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning
training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we
aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in
particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across
hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully
leveraging available GPU compute capacity.

Result: LLM在法律遵循等结构化领域表现迅速，但在处理上下文细节、确保负责和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: LLM目前仅适合作为决策支持工具，不应作为自主伦理判断代理，必须强调人类在环中的监督作用

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和节点配置的全面优化方法。

Method: Maestro框架在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具、控制参数），并利用轨迹中的反思性文本反馈来优先编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均分别超过MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge 12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使在仅优化提示的情况下，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollouts。在两个应用（面试官和RAG智能体）上也显示出巨大优势。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法解决的结构性故障模式，Maestro在样本效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI指标无法全面抓住AI模型的细致能力，需要结合人类认知标准来提高评估的可解释性和应用性

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA指标，进行深度访谈和大规模调查，识别优先级设定、记忆、辨别、上下文化等关键认知技能

Result: 发现人们认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有高期望，通过整合这些发现提出了人类对齐的评测框架

Conclusion: 用户中心的评估在AI发展中至关重要，本研究为实现AI能力与人类认知过程对齐提供了可操作的指南，改善了当前指标并为未来AI模型评估奠定基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张通过语言驱动的分层世界模型来解决复杂多智能体任务中的探索困难和稀疏奖励问题，提出利用大语言模型动态生成层次化框架来指导智能体学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能发展中，语言模型和智能体模型已有显著进展，但显式的世界模型发展滞后，特别是在复杂长时域多智能体任务中成为关键瓶颈。标准强化学习在高保真但结构平坦的模拟器中训练智能体时，由于难以处理的探索空间和稀疏奖励而经常失败。

Method: 提出层次化框架方法，将复杂目标分解为结构化、可管理的子目标。利用大语言模型动态生成这种层次化框架，通过语言即时构建世界模型。构建具有显式、语言可配置任务层的环境。

Result: 通过对2024年多智能体足球研究的系统回顾，发现了将符号化和层次化方法与多智能体强化学习(MARL)整合的明确趋势，这些方法隐式或显式地构建基于任务的世界模型来指导智能体学习。

Conclusion: 语言驱动的世界模型提供了内在课程、密集有意义的学习信号和组合学习框架，使智能体模型能够以更高的样本效率获得复杂的战略行为。通过构建具有显式语言可配置任务层的环境，可以弥合低层反应行为与高层战略团队协作之间的差距，为训练下一代智能智能体创建强大且可推广的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，使大语言模型具备主动思考能力，能够在复杂动态环境中预测行动后果，在王者荣耀游戏中达到74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，无法在行动前预测潜在后果，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出WiA-LLM范式，整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是响应当前条件。

Result: 在王者荣耀复杂游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了向主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个多代理LLM框架，通过五个专业代理提供交互式自然语言解释，弥合了复杂RL策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XRL方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要改进RL策略的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 采用五代理架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四水箱过程控制问题上验证成功，查询映射准确率高，编码器-调试器交互最小化了反事实生成失败，定性评估确认能有效解释代理行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架成功解决了XRL工具的可访问性和解释质量问题，为RL策略提供了有效的自然语言解释解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统性研究语言模型长期合作行为的成果，为更复杂的人工智能-人类混合社交环境研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Motivation: 自动化重复性任务、降低运营成本、提供24小时支持，通过克隆优秀人员的对话模式来提升语音助手的性能。

Method: 使用自动语音识别(ASR)、基于大语言模型的对话管理器和文本转语音合成(TTS)技术，构建流式推理流水线，通过领域选择、知识提取和prompt工程来学习顶尖人员的结构化脚本。

Result: 在22项评价标准下，AI助手在常规通话方面接近人类表现，但在说服和异议处理方面较弱，盲测评估显示了这些不足。

Conclusion: 分析了系统的短板并对prompt进行了精炼，提出了设计经验和未来研究方向，包括大规模模拟和自动化评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在智能体选择和结果聚合方面已有进展，但专家智能体之间深度协作的高效语言交互仍然是关键瓶颈，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能够动态感知合作者的认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格）。

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作中的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了定位精度和推理速度，同时支持对整个界面的细粒度解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM GUI感知方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低和推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出基于预训练MLLM的连续坐标建模方法，增加token路由器和坐标解码器；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准来系统评估GUI模型的结构感知能力。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在精度和速度方面都有显著提升，为GUI解析提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型作为对话代理时的可控性问题，确保可预测和用户个性化的响应，特别是对定性对话特征进行形式化定义的需求。

Method: 提出基于本体的方法，使用语言描述符将定性概念转化为定量定义，在描述逻辑中形式化并构建本体，通过微调指导LLM的受控文本生成。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够提供一致且可解释的熟练度级别定义，提高了对话AI的透明度。

Conclusion: 本体论方法为LLM对话控制提供了有效的形式化框架，特别是在语言熟练度控制方面实现了更好的可解释性和一致性。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Motivation: 随着AI智能体在互联网中的广泛应用，需要建立有效的智能体排名系统来选择和评估智能体的实际性能，但当前缺乏全局透明的交互网络和统一的性能评估标准。

Method: 提出DOVIS五层操作协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）来收集隐私保护的性能数据，并开发AgentRank-UC算法结合使用频率和能力指标进行动态排名。

Conclusion: DOVIS和AgentRank-UC为构建机器原生的Web of Agents生态系统提供了可行的技术方案，能够实现智能体的有效选择、排名和协作。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽视了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法来提高推理效率和性能。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，协调三个协作的LRM模型，通过提炼关键条件（称为sticker）来驱动关键信息的提取、精炼和跨轮次重用。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自我改进实现渐进式精炼。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25、OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在可比推理预算下 consistently超越强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了sticker引导的历史经验利用的有效性，为大型推理模型的测试时扩展提供了新的高效框架。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Abstract: Innovators often exhibit cognitive fixation on existing solutions or nascent
ideas, hindering the exploration of novel alternatives. This paper introduces a
methodology for constructing Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs), interconnected
representations of functional elements that support abstraction, problem
reframing, and analogical inspiration. Our approach yields large-scale,
high-quality FCGs with explicit abstraction relations, overcoming limitations
of prior work. We further present MUSE, an algorithm leveraging FCGs to
generate creative inspirations for a given problem. We demonstrate our method
by computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research.

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标并提供针对性反馈，在多智能体环境中有效促进亲社会行为，相比现有大语言模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的合作挑战，旨在开发能够促进亲社会行为的AI系统。

Method: 使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，然后通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的反馈信息进行沟通。

Result: 在Doors、Keys and Gems以及Overcooked环境中，ProToM相比基线方法实现了更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并获得人类用户的一致偏好。

Conclusion: 现有大语言和推理模型在提供上下文接地且时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足，而ProToM能够提供有针对性的有用反馈，有效促进多智能体合作。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

TL;DR: 本文为ODRL语言提供了基于查询应答的正式语义，改进了之前的规范化工作，并定义了策略比较问题来检测等效、更严格或更宽松的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL已成为数字资源访问和使用的实际标准语言，但尽管在语言特性的形式化规范方面已取得初步进展，但仍缺乏全面的正式语义。

Method: 基于查询应答提供简单直观的ODRL正式语义，该语义改进了之前的规范化工作，并与语言最新规范(2.2版)保持一致。

Result: 建立了ODRL的正式语义框架，并在此基础上定义了策略比较问题，能够检测策略之间的等效性、严格性和宽松性关系。

Conclusion: 提出的正式语义为ODRL策略评估和比较提供了理论基础，特别适用于数据共享场景中的策略分析需求。

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo
video is available at https://youtu.be/8VWZXpERR18
