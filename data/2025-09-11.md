Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对埃塞俄比亚南部的Wolaita和Gofa双语识别任务，提出结合BERT预训练模型和LSTM的方法，在测试集上取得0.72的F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言社区中，文本常包含多种语言，而Wolaita和Gofa语言之间存在词汇相似性和差异性，使得双语识别任务具有挑战性

Method: 采用多种实验方法，最终确定BERT预训练语言模型与LSTM相结合的方法

Result: 在测试集上获得0.72的F1分数，表现最佳

Conclusion: 该工作能有效处理社交媒体中的多语言问题，并为该领域的进一步研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote是一种双层优化方法，通过对抗性超网络训练LLM抵抗恶意微调攻击，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施难以在保持模型通用能力的同时抵抗拥有完整模型访问权限的对手攻击

Method: 使用双层优化程序训练LLM，包含一个辅助对抗性超网络学习生成恶意LoRA权重，主模型训练目标是对抗这些权重添加的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比现有方法强27.4%，在MMLU等基准测试中性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: 该方法为构建安全性更强、计算效率更高的开源权重模型提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

### [3] [MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022)
*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVPBench是一个包含24,020个实例的基准测试，系统评估LLM在75个国家与多维人类价值观的对齐程度，揭示了跨地域和人口统计的显著差异，并证明轻量级微调方法能有效提升对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽视文化和人口多样性，导致对价值观对齐在全球范围内泛化能力的理解有限，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 构建MVPBench基准，包含精细价值标签、个性化问题和丰富人口统计元数据；使用LoRA和DPO等轻量级微调方法进行实验验证。

Result: 发现不同LLM在地理和人口统计线上存在显著的对齐性能差异；轻量级微调方法在域内和域外设置中都能显著提升价值对齐效果。

Conclusion: 强调人口感知对齐评估的必要性，为构建文化适应性和价值敏感的LLM提供实用见解，MVPBench为全球对齐、个性化价值建模和公平AI发展奠定基础。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciGPT是一个针对科学文献理解的领域自适应基础模型，通过低成本的领域蒸馏、稀疏专家混合注意力机制和知识感知适应等创新技术，在科学任务上超越GPT-4o表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献呈指数级增长，研究人员需要高效的知识合成工具。通用大语言模型在科学领域存在技术术语理解不足、方法学严谨性把握困难等问题，限制了其在跨学科研究中的实用性

Method: 基于Qwen3架构，采用三阶段创新：1）两阶段低成本领域蒸馏平衡性能与效率；2）稀疏专家混合注意力机制降低长文档推理内存消耗55%；3）知识感知适应整合领域本体论以弥合跨学科知识差距

Conclusion: SciGPT验证了其在促进AI增强科学发现方面的潜力，为科学文献理解提供了有效的领域自适应解决方案

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM个性化可能导致虚假拒绝问题，但通过系统测试发现模型能力和任务类型对虚假拒绝的影响比人物设定更大，人物设定效应可能被高估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型日益个性化，但人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，需要量化这种问题的严重程度

Method: 使用15种社会人口统计人物设定、16个不同模型、3个任务和9种提示改写，提出基于蒙特卡洛的方法来高效量化虚假拒绝问题

Result: 模型能力越强，人物设定对拒绝率的影响越小；某些社会人口统计人物设定会增加部分模型的虚假拒绝率；模型选择和任务类型对虚假拒绝有显著影响，特别是在敏感内容任务中

Conclusion: 人物设定效应可能被高估，虚假拒绝问题更多受模型能力和任务类型影响，而非人物设定本身

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [7] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明LLMs能够通过信息瓶颈原则演化出类似人类的高效语义系统，在颜色命名任务中表现出与人类相似的压缩效率和跨语言模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够像人类语言系统一样，通过信息瓶颈原则演化出高效的语义分类系统，而不是仅仅模仿训练数据中的模式

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0-flash和Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct模型，复制两个重要的人类行为研究：英语颜色命名研究和通过上下文学习模拟文化演化

Result: Gemini与英语母语者的命名模式高度一致且获得高IB效率分数，Llama表现出高效但复杂度较低的系统；两种模型都能通过迭代学习将随机系统重构为更高IB效率，与世界各地语言模式更加一致

Conclusion: LLMs能够演化出基于感知的人类化语义系统，其驱动原理与人类语言语义效率的基本原理相同

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略和DoRA权重适配，显著提升了低资源语言的复杂推理能力，在AfriMGSM基准上比MindMerger准确率提升12.9个百分点，甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在英语上表现优异，但在许多低资源语言的复杂推理方面仍有困难。现有的编码器-解码器方法对中高资源语言有效，但对低资源语言存在较大差距。

Method: 提出MERLIN两阶段模型堆叠框架，采用课程学习策略（从通用双语平行文本到任务特定数据），仅适配少量DoRA权重。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上准确率比MindMerger提升+12.9pp，超越GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上也分别获得+0.9和+2.8pp的稳定提升。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架在低资源和高资源环境下都表现出有效性，为低资源语言的复杂推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现假设大语言模型的偏见不会转移到适配模型是危险的，偏见可通过提示式适配转移，并评估了多种去偏见策略的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明偏见转移假设的危险性，研究提示适配中偏见转移现象，因为提示是实际应用中极其流行和可访问的适配策略

Method: 在因果模型中研究提示适配下的偏见转移假设，分析内在偏见与提示适配后偏见的相关性，评估多种去偏见策略的效果

Result: 发现偏见可通过提示转移，不同人口统计特征和任务中偏见相关性强度达到0.69-0.98，并评估了多种去偏见策略的效果

Conclusion: 纠正内在模型的偏见可能防止偏见向下游任务传播，同时有助于提高推理能力

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了语言化算法（VAs）范式，利用经典算法理论，将复杂任务分解为LLM能可靠处理的简单自然语言操作，如使用LLM作为二元比较器的排序网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式在推理任务中不可靠，需要更系统的方法来确保正确性。

Method: 将任务分解为简单的基本操作（如字符串比较），让LLM只负责这些可靠的小任务，然后使用经典算法（如位排序网络）来组织这些操作。

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言化算法提供了一种更可靠的方式来利用LLM进行复杂推理任务，通过限制LLM只处理其擅长的简单操作，结合经典算法的理论保证。

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有标注者过滤方法在主观任务中会错误移除意见分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，导致准确性和标签多样性的次优权衡。研究发现保守的标注者移除比例(<5%)最佳，且垃圾标注者通常比非垃圾标注者更不随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集需要既保留数据标签的多样性变化，又过滤掉垃圾或低质量响应，但如何在标注者可靠性和代表性之间取得平衡尚不清楚。

Method: 通过实证评估一系列标注者过滤启发式方法对主观任务中变异保留的影响，并在合成垃圾数据上分析性能。

Result: 现有方法经常移除意见分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，保守设置(<5%移除率)效果最好。垃圾标注者通常分布上与真实标注者无法区分，且倾向于给出固定答案而非随机答案。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够考虑标签多样性的垃圾移除方法，因为现有基于变异即垃圾假设的方法在需要保留变异的任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同格式文档如何共享信息对信息检索、摘要生成和内容对齐任务至关重要。

Method: 采用问题回答基础方法，通过文档间共享问题的可回答性来表征语义覆盖关系，使用SQuAD语料库构建综合数据集进行训练和评测。

Result: 判别模型表现显著超过生成模型，RoBERTa-base模型达到61.4%的最高准确率，Random Forest模型在平均F1分数上表现最佳为52.9%。

Conclusion: 问题回答提供了有效的视角来评估不同风格文本间的语义关系，为当前模型的信息理解能力提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETLCH是一个基于LLaMA的10亿参数模型，通过少量样本微调在结构化数据提取任务中表现出色，证明了小模型在资源受限环境中的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取任务中成本高昂且需要大量高质量数据，小型团队难以承受。目前缺乏小模型在低资源多任务条件下的可靠性证据

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术对LLaMA基础模型进行微调，每个任务仅使用几百到一千个样本，用于JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上优于强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益

Conclusion: 精心调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本提供稳定准确的结构化输出，使资源受限环境中的信息提取管道变得经济高效和可靠

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有语音关系抽取数据集依赖合成数据，缺乏真实语音的多样性和数量；现有模型存在生成模板单一和语义对齐弱的问题

Method: RPG-MoGe框架：1）多序三元组生成集成策略，利用不同元素顺序增强数据多样性；2）基于CNN的潜在关系预测头生成显式关系提示，指导跨模态对齐和准确三元组生成

Result: 实验表明该方法优于最先进方法，为真实世界语音关系抽取提供了基准数据集和有效解决方案

Conclusion: 提出的CommonVoice-SpeechRE数据集和RPG-MoGe框架解决了现有语音关系抽取的数据和模型限制，为实际应用提供了有力支撑

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发能够抵御对抗性操作的弹性事实核查框架的紧迫性，并指出了需要进一步探索的开放研究问题。

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

TL;DR: 大语言模型存在"否定偏吐"，与人类的"同意偏吐"相反，更倾向于回答"不"


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为LLM在训练数据和输入敏感性方面与人类相似，研究者想知道它们是否也会出现类似于人类的同意偏吐

Method: 在不同模型、任务和语言（英语、德语、波兰语）上进行实验研究，调查LLM的回答偏吐

Result: 结果显示LLM与人类相反，存在明显的"否定偏吐"，无论问题的意义如何，都更倾向于回答"不"

Conclusion: 大语言模型并不像人类那样存在同意偏吐，而是反向的否定偏吐，这对LLM的评估和应用有重要意义

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人物提示法是否会导致LLMs在生成与社会人口类别相关的文本时产生不同水平的语言抽象度（刻板印象的标记）

Method: 基于语言学期望偏差框架，分析6个开源LLMs在三种提示条件下的输出，比较11个人物驱动响应与通用AI助手的响应，使用具体性、特异性和否定性三个指标测量抽象度

Result: 人物提示法在调节语言抽象方面存在局限性，确认了人物作为社会人口群体代表性的生态学批评，并引发了对传播刻板印象风险的担忧

Conclusion: 人物提示法在减少语言刻板印象方面效果有限，需要更谨慎地使用这种方法以避免强化社会偏见

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

TL;DR: TrinityX是一个模块化对齐框架，通过混合校准专家(MoCaE)在Transformer架构中分别训练HHH三个维度的专家，使用任务自适应路由机制整合输出，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构存在路由校准问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含分别训练的HHH维度专家，通过校准的任务自适应路由机制整合专家输出，形成统一的对齐感知表示。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中：Alpaca(有帮助性)、BeaverTails(无害性)、TruthfulQA(诚实性)，TrinityX相对基线提升32.5%胜率、33.9%安全分数和28.4%真实性，同时减少40%以上内存使用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过混合校准专家架构有效解决了LLM对齐问题，校准路由机制是关键，且具有良好的跨模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Motivation: 解决现有多语言对齐方法中的两大问题：英语响应质量不高导致对齐偏差，以及偏见或经验主义的多语言偏好对构建方法

Method: CM-Align方法，包含两部分：一致性引导的英语参考选择，以及跨语言一致性基础的多语言偏好数据构建

Result: 在三个大语言模型和三个常见任务上验证了方法的有效性和优势性

Conclusion: 高质量偏好数据的构建对多语言对齐至关重要

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

TL;DR: 本文探索如何利用多个大语言模型的集成方式，在不需要精细调整或标签数据的情况下，实现生物医学预判判断问题答案的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学问题答案面临专业知识复杂、数据量庞大且迅速发展的挑战，需要准确解释专业知识。研究考虑如何利用大语言模型进行信息检索，并通过集成方法在预判判断问题上达到最先进性能。

Method: 采用多个大语言模型（包括Anthropic和Google的模型）的集成方式，综合各模型的输出以生成更准确和稳健的答案。方法不需要精细调整或标签数据，但强调信息检索在检索-增强生成方案中的关键作用。

Result: 在BioASQ挑战任务上的评估显示，集成方法超过了单个大语言模型的性能，某些情况下甚至可以与领域特定调整系统相竞争或更优。研究还发现上下文长度与性能存在关联：展开的上下文虽能提供有价值证据，但同时也带来信息淀沉和模型迷失的风险。

Conclusion: 集成基于零检查的方法，结合有效的检索-增强生成流程，构成了一种实用且可扩展的替代方案，可以替代预调整的领域特定系统用于生物医学问题答案。精确、聚焦的信息检索仍然是确保大语言模型在相关信息边界内生成答案的关键基础。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Motivation: 现有基于语法树和方面感知注意力的方法难以建模复杂语义关系，线性点积特征无法捕捉非线性关联，导致无关词汇的噪声相似性掩盖关键观点词。

Method: 提出OTESGN模型，包含语法图感知注意力挖掘潜在语法依赖和全局语法拓扑，语义最优传输注意力在文本噪声中发现细粒度语义对齐，自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，对比正则化提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在Twitter数据集上F1提升1.01%，在Laptop14数据集上F1提升1.30%，达到最先进水平。消融研究和可视化分析验证了其在精确定位观点词和抗噪声方面的有效性。

Conclusion: OTESGN通过最优传输和语法-语义协同注意力机制，有效解决了ABSA任务中的噪声干扰和复杂语义关系建模问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Motivation: 现有的M2S压缩方法依赖少量手动编写的模板，需要自动化方法来发现和优化更有效的单轮探测模板。

Method: 使用语言模型引导的进化框架，结合12个来源的智能采样和基于StrongREJECT的LLM-as-judge评估，设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行五代进化。

Result: 获得了5个进化世代、2个新模板家族，在GPT-4.1上达到44.8%总体成功率（103/230）。跨模型评估显示结构增益可迁移但随目标变化，发现提示长度与得分呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是获得更强单轮探测的可重复途径，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的序列到序列生成要么是离线方式（完整输入后才开始输出），要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供一种更灵活、简单的流式多模态序列生成方案。

Method: 使用仅解码器的语言模型，通过预处理步骤对时间对齐的流进行延迟处理，在不同流之间引入适当的延迟，从而实现任意输出序列的流式推理。

Result: 在自动语音识别(ASR)和文本到语音(TTS)两大序列到序列任务上，DSM实现了最先进的性能和延迟，支持任意长序列，甚至可与离线基线相媲美。

Conclusion: DSM提供了一个通用、灵活的流式多模态序列到序列学习框架，通过简单的延迟对齐机制实现了优异的性能和低延迟，适用于多种序列生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要，但先前研究主要基于GPT风格模型，不清楚这些发现是否适用于不同自回归架构

Method: 对多个模型（GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek）进行事实回忆的综合评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问

Result: 发现基于Qwen的模型表现出与先前模式不同的行为：最早层的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也可能导致根本不同的事实回忆机制

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

TL;DR: MoVoC提出了一种结合形态分析和BPE的分词方法，为吉兹文字语言构建形态感知的子词词汇表，在保持形态完整性的同时提高分词效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法在低资源、形态复杂的语言（如吉兹文字语言）中往往无法保持形态边界，导致分词效果不佳

Method: 提出MoVoC方法，将监督式形态分析整合到子词词汇表中，结合基于语素和BPE的分词方式，构建混合分割方法

Result: 虽然机器翻译质量没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和边界精度上获得一致改进，提高了语言保真度和分词效率

Conclusion: 形态感知的分词方法对增强语言保真度有价值，发布的形态标注数据集和分词器将支持低资源形态丰富语言的进一步研究

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在英语语料库构建，缺乏对其他语言有效训练语料库构建方法的理解，需要探索如何为其他语言构建高质量的LLM训练数据。

Method: 采用持续预训练设置，研究不同数据选择和预处理策略；开发语言特定的过滤流程，包括教育、STEM内容和有毒内容分类器；构建120B token的葡萄牙语网络语料库。

Result: 构建的葡萄牙语语料库达到工业级语料库的竞争性结果；语言特定过滤管道显示出价值；模型适应目标语言后性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 高质量、语言特定的数据对LLM性能至关重要；虽然案例研究聚焦葡萄牙语，但方法适用于其他语言，为多语言LLM开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

TL;DR: LLM在社会科学研究中存在"LLM hacking"风险，研究者的实现选择（模型、提示策略等）会导致系统偏差和随机错误，在37个数据标注任务中发现约1/3的偏差得出错误结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和量化大语言模型在社会科学研究中应用时的风险，研究者的实现选择可能导致系统性偏差和统计错误，影响研究结论的可靠性。

Method: 复现21项已发表社会科学研究中的37个数据标注任务，使用18个不同模型生成1300万个LLM标签，测试2361个实际假设来量化研究者选择对统计结论的影响。

Result: 发现约1/3的偏差使用最先进模型时得出错误结论，小型语言模型中这一比例达到一半。高任务性能和更好的模型能力能降低风险但不能完全消除。人工标注有助减少偏差，而常见的回归估计校正技术效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM hacking是社会科学研究中的重大风险，研究者需要更严格的验证流程和人工标注来确保结论的可靠性，尤其是在显著性阈值附近的发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Motivation: 深度伪造生成技术快速发展，传统非持续学习方法需要频繁且昂贵的重训练，无法有效应对新兴伪造技术的挑战。

Method: 提出持续学习框架，模拟真实世界7年间深度伪造技术的时序演进，基于轻量级视觉骨干网络实现实时检测性能，并引入两个新评估指标。

Result: 框架实现了高效适应（比完全重训练快155倍）和稳健的历史知识保留，但对未来生成器的泛化能力接近随机水平（FWT-AUC≈0.5）。

Conclusion: 提出了非通用深度伪造分布假说，指出现有方法对未来生成器的泛化能力有限，需要新的解决方案来应对深度伪造技术的持续演进。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不可学习性的内在机制，提出的量化评估方法有助于社区认识现有不可学习方法的能力边界，推动真正不可学习样本的发展。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私保护是两个重要问题，现有研究对梯度压缩和差分隐私机制的分析是孤立的，需要一种联合分析方法

Method: 提出SGM机制，结合梯度压缩草图技术和高斯机制，使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，并应用于梯度下降和自适应服务器优化器的联邦学习

Result: 证明SGM的隐私水平与草图维度b的平方根成反比，在相同噪声预算下提供比原始高斯机制更强的隐私保护，收敛性仅对参数数量d有对数依赖

Conclusion: SGM在相同隐私级别下与非草图私有FL变体竞争甚至更优，服务器端使用自适应优化能提升性能同时保持隐私保证

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 联邦学习分布式特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，现有防御方法在面对自适应攻击者时表现不佳，特别是缺乏对强大但未充分探索的自适应攻击者的有效防御。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的自适应攻击者，超越现有攻击能力；然后提出了Hammer and Anvil防御框架，将两种基于不同原理的防御方法（Krum+）相结合。

Result: 新攻击方法仅需20个客户端中的1-2个恶意客户端就能攻破现有最先进防御；提出的Krum+组合防御成功抵御了新自适应攻击者和最先进攻击。

Conclusion: 通过正交防御方法的组合可以构建出能够抵御任何攻击的强大防御体系，Krum+防御在面对新型自适应攻击时表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Motivation: 基于AI的心电图分析受限于标注数据不足，自监督学习可以利用大规模未标注数据，但现有方法缺乏对ECG生理特性的考虑。

Method: 提出PhysioCLR框架：1）在对比学习中整合ECG生理相似性线索；2）引入保持ECG类别的特定增强技术；3）使用混合损失函数优化表示质量。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Credibility Transformer的新范式，通过添加上下文学习机制来增强模型性能，能够处理训练时未见过的分类特征水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典Transformer架构，通过可信度机制和上下文学习来提高模型学习和预测性能，特别是处理训练数据中未出现过的新类别特征。

Method: 在Credibility Transformer基础上增加上下文学习机制，使用包含相似实例的上下文批次来增强CLS令牌表示，通过额外上下文信息进行微调。

Result: 实证验证表明上下文学习通过适应相似风险模式提高了预测准确性，并且能够泛化到训练时未见过的分类协变量特征水平的新实例。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文学习机制有效增强了Credibility Transformer的性能，使其能够处理新出现的类别特征，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

TL;DR: 一种统一的多模型机器学习框架，统合大语言模型和传统机器学习算法，用于预测投资预测中的稀罕高影响事件，在准确性和可解释性方面取得显著成效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决投资预测中面临的挑战：数据有限、噪声多、稀罕事件预测困难，同时需要结合黑盒模型的预测能力和可解释性来支持可靠决策。

Method: 整合LLM进行特征工程，从非结构化数据中提取复杂信号，使用层叠集成模型（XGBoost、Random Forest、Linear Regression）进行预测，先生成连续成功概率估计，再通过阈值化生成二进制稀罕事件预测。

Result: 模型表现突出：在三个独立测试子集中，精确度达到随机分类器基准的9.8-11.1倍；特征敏感性分析显示创业公司类别占预测影响力的15.6%，创始人数量次之，教育水平和领域专业知识也有一定贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效预测风投预测中的稀罕高影响事件，既保持了黑盒模型的预测能力，又提供了可解释性支持，为投资决策提供了可靠的数据支撑。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理回归和分类任务中的多属性公平性问题，捕获线性和非线性依赖关系，为实际应用提供了可行的公平性解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Conclusion: MARLINE能够有效处理非平稳环境中的概念漂移问题，即使源概念与目标概念不匹配也能成功利用多源知识，显著提高了预测准确性

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖固定因果结构的马尔可夫链，无法捕捉自然语言中动态变化的token关系，需要探索Transformer在动态因果结构下的能力。

Method: 使用具有不同滞后的交错马尔可夫链来变化因果结构，保持转移概率固定，通过3层Transformer实现选择性归纳头机制。

Result: Transformer学会了通过识别正确滞后并从过去复制相应token来预测下一个token，该机制渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer选择因果结构的能力，为理解其功能和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究使用生成对抗网络(WGAN-GP)咄去噪模型(DDPM)来生成真实的EEG人工假像数据，以解决EEG中假像标签成本高的问题。结果显示WGAN-GP在谱对齐方面更优，但两种模型的类别条件恢复能力都较弱，限制了数据增帽效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG中的各种人工假像(肌肉、眼球运动、电极、咬喃、发抖等)影响自动化分析的准确性，但大规模标注成本较高。需要一种能够生成真实且带标签的人工假像数据的方法，用于数据增帽咄压力测试。

Method: 使用TUH EEG Artifact(TUAR)数据集，进行主题分割咄固定长度多通道窗口预处理。比较两种生成模型：条件WGAN-GP(带投影别除器)咄1D去噪模型(带分类器免指导)。通过三个维度评估：保真度(谱带功率、协方差、自相关、分布距离)、特异性(类别条件恢复)、实用性(数据增帽效果)。

Result: WGAN-GP模型在谱对齐方面表现更好，与真实数据的最大均差(MMD)更小。但两种模型都显示出较弱的类别条件恢复能力，导致数据增帽的立即改善效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG人工假像生成建立了可复现的基准线，展示了现有模型在条件控制方面的不足。持续改进条件控制机制咄覆盖范围将是未来研究的重点方向。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的数值格式和训练策略，显著提升了降阶模型在长时间预测中的准确性和稳定性

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.

empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调时面临灾难性遗忘问题，需要平衡下游任务性能和预训练知识保留

Method: 基于任务向量与预训练参数重叠度的剪枝指标，无需修改训练过程或模型架构，也不需要辅助数据

Result: 在8个数据集上实验，涵盖自然语言推理、问答、阅读理解等多种任务，遗忘率仅0.25%，下游任务准确率99.67%

Conclusion: FAPM是一种有效的灾难性遗忘缓解方法，通过剪枝指标实现了性能与遗忘的平衡

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Conclusion: 该框架旨在普及视觉语言模型科学推理能力的研究，促进对其能力和局限性的深入理解。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Method: 提出矩阵轮廓加权集成(MPWE)框架，采用机制切换方法动态捕捉多地理模型预测间的协变依赖关系，并结合冗余感知加权来平衡各模型贡献。

Result: 在越南8个主要流域、5个预测时间尺度(1小时及12-84小时累积降雨)上的实验表明，MPWE相比地理模型和集成基线方法，预测误差的均值和标准差均显著降低。

Conclusion: MPWE框架能够有效提升降雨预测的准确性和稳定性，在不同流域和预测时间尺度上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习自动调制识别模型需要大量标注数据，但在新模型开发或超参数调优时，重复训练的时间和能耗成本过高

Method: 记录完整数据集训练过程中每个样本的预测轨迹，基于训练动态构建三个重要性指标来选择核心集

Result: 在多个AMR数据集上，仅使用1%-30%的原始数据就能保持高识别精度，并具有良好的跨架构泛化能力

Conclusion: FoQuS方法有效解决了大规模数据训练的高成本问题，为AMR模型开发提供了高效的训练方案

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

TL;DR: EvolKV是一个自适应KV缓存压缩框架，通过进化搜索动态配置各层预算，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法通常依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化性能下降。

Method: 将缓存分配重新表述为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验表明，该方法在长上下文任务中优于所有基线方法，在GSM8K上比启发式基线高出7个百分点，仅使用1.5%原始预算就能在代码补全任务上超越完整KV缓存性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了学习式KV缓存预算分配策略的未开发潜力，能够在极低预算下实现优异性能。

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

TL;DR: 使用预训练大语言模型作为导师，通过学生-教师架构加速强化学习算法的收敛速度，实验证明LLM指导能显著减少训练时间并保持相近的最优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速技术如奖励塑形和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定。研究探索LLM作为通用导师来加速RL收敛

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）为RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）生成指导建议，并在多个环境（Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four）中进行54种配置的实证研究，探索建议重用机制

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛，同时保持可比较的最优性能。建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间但导致收敛动态不太稳定。效果对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感

Conclusion: LLM指导能有效改善强化学习收敛性能，但其效果取决于任务-算法-模型的特定组合，建议重用虽能加速训练但需要谨慎使用以避免不稳定性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型参数庞大导致GPU内存需求过高，专家卸载到CPU RAM的方法由于缓存命中率低和加载延迟大，导致推理速度显著下降

Method: 提出专家垂直分割机制（top和bottom段），缓存热点专家的top段以提高缓存命中率；预测下一层激活专家并预取；基于定点迭代的自适应缓存配置算法

Result: 实验表明MoEpic可节省约50%的GPU成本，相比基线方法降低37.51%-65.73%的推理延迟

Conclusion: MoEpic通过创新的专家分割和智能缓存管理，有效解决了MoE模型推理时的内存和延迟问题，为大规模MoE模型的广泛应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来改进决策聚焦学习的方法，解决了传统DFL训练不稳定的问题，同时保持决策质量优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测聚焦学习(PFL)和决策聚焦学习(DFL)各有优缺点：PFL训练稳定但忽略下游决策质量，DFL直接优化决策质量但训练不稳定。需要一种结合两者优势的方法

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，采用sigmoid-like衰减参数让预测损失梯度引导决策损失梯度，无需额外训练，可与任何DFL求解器集成

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比基线方法获得更低遗憾值和更稳定的训练，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下也能取得良好效果

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功结合了PFL的训练稳定性和DFL的决策质量优化优势，提供了理论收敛保证，是一种简单有效的决策聚焦学习改进方案

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Method: 用冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)替换FFREEDA框架中的骨干网络，避免大量参数调优，同时减少联邦学习中的计算和通信开销

Result: 实验结果表明VFM能有效缓解域差距、类别不平衡和客户端非独立同分布问题的影响，显著提高整体准确率

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器而非复杂的适应或联邦学习方法，是现实世界联邦学习成功的关键

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Motivation: 图形VQ-MAE在多域TAGs中显示出艺术的表征能力，但域泛化冲突导致了不可见的风险，需要解决模型退化和表征失效这两种问题

Method: 提出MoT（Mixture-of-Tinkers）方案：(1)信息优化器：使用边约束语义融合策略和域感知路由的混合代码本来提升信息容量；(2)正则化优化器：通过两个额外正则化来改善梯度监督

Result: 在6个域的22个数据集上的实验显示，MoT在监督学习、少量样本和零样本场景中都取得了显著改进，超越了SOTA基线方法

Conclusion: MoT通过信息瓶颈和正则化缺失的解决方案，有效地减轻了GFM预训练中的优化困境，同时遵循GFM的缩放法则，提供了可控的模型规模

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出Generative Data Refinement (GDR)框架，使用预训练生成模型将有不良内容的数据集转化为更适合训练的净化数据集，解决训练数据短缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型能力主要取决于训练数据质量和数量，但网络公开数据增长跟不上训练数据需求，预计未来十年将出现数据枯竭。用户生成内容虽然丰富但包含隐私信息和不良内容，直接使用风险较大。

Method: 使用预训练生成模型，以真实数据集中的每个样本为条件生成合成数据，将包含不良内容的数据集转化为净化后的数据集。这种方法避免了通过模型提示生成多样化合成数据的挑战。

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能够直接对高度不安全的数据集进行去毒处理。生成的合成数据自然匹配网络规模数据集的多样性。

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具，为解决数据短缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

TL;DR: MoT是一个轻量级框架，通过交替进行教师特定监督微调和权重空间合并，将多个教师的推理能力统一到学生模型中，仅用约200个高质量CoT样本就在数学竞赛基准上超越了多个强大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏假设单一最优教师，但实践中存在多个候选教师和不断增长的CoT语料库。研究发现不同学生有不同"最佳教师"，同一学生的最佳教师也会因数据集而异。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)框架：交替进行教师特定的监督微调分支，然后对产生的学生变体进行权重空间合并，以统一多个教师的推理能力并克服监督冲突。

Result: 在数学竞赛基准上，仅用约200个高质量CoT样本，Qwen3-14B学生模型超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B等多个强大模型。MoT始终优于最佳单教师蒸馏和朴素多教师联合方法，提高了性能上限并减轻过拟合。

Conclusion: MoT是一种简单、可扩展的方法，能够高效地从多样化教师中蒸馏长链推理能力到紧凑学生模型中，减少灾难性遗忘，提升数学以外的通用推理能力，甚至培养出更好的教师。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Motivation: 现有研究通常在固定的事件日志集上评估算法，缺乏系统分析事件日志特征如何单独影响算法性能，且忽视了特征共现的问题

Method: 提出SHAining方法，使用流程发现作为下游任务，分析超过22,000个覆盖广泛特征的事件日志，量化不同特征对算法度量指标（如适应度、精确度、复杂度）的边际贡献

Result: 揭示了哪些事件日志特征对算法度量指标影响最大，并提供了关于特征值与其贡献影响之间相关性的新见解

Conclusion: SHAining方法能够系统评估事件日志特征对流程挖掘算法性能的影响，为算法选择和评估提供了更全面的分析框架

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

Conclusion: 结构化潜在表示对算子学习很重要，生成模型与算子网络结合在热设计和更广泛工程应用中具有潜力

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Motivation: 研究梯度下降中重球动量算法的数学本质，理解其在优化过程中的动力学行为，为分析其他优化算法提供理论框架。

Method: 基于Kovachki和Stuart(2021)的工作，在指数吸引不变流形上分析HB算法，推导连续修正方程和主流动，建立全局近似边界。

Result: 证明了HB算法在适当条件下等价于修正损失函数的梯度下降，发现了丰富的多项式组合结构，提供了任意阶的精确近似边界。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解重球动量算法的内在机制提供了新的理论视角，为分析其他优化算法奠定了基础，揭示了动量优化中的深层数学结构。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型神经模型在高风险场景中的部署增加，需要确保其行为与人类价值观可靠对齐，而当前的事后解释方法存在局限性

Method: 提倡采用机制性可解释性方法（如电路追踪、激活修补）而非事后方法（如LIME、SHAP），这些方法能提供对内部故障的因果洞察

Result: 机制性可解释性方法能够揭示行为方法（如RLHF、红队测试）可能忽略的欺骗性或不对齐推理模式

Conclusion: AI安全和可信度的进展取决于将可解释性作为AI研发的一等目标，确保系统不仅有效而且可审计、透明且与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比十种优化器在心脏病预测任务中的表现，提出了根据收敛速度、稳定性和分类指标综合评估优化器的方法，并推荐RMSProp为最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型训练中优化器选择很少得到具体研究，需要深入探讨优化器选择的标准和指标。

Method: 使用心脏病数据集训练多层感知机模型，在一致的训练范式下比较10种优化器的性能，评估收敛速度、稳定性、AUC、精度和召回等指标。

Result: RMSProp在这个任务中表现最佳，精度0.765、召回0.827、AUC 0.841，训练时间较快，但稳定性不是最好。Adagrad和Adadelta更稳定但收敛更慢。

Conclusion: 建议在计算资源充足的情况下，通过综合评估收敛速度、稳定性和分类指标来选择优化器，以提高深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在24小时运动行为分类任务中的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腐加速度计数据，采用4种DL算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种传统ML算法，分别使用原始信号和手工特征进行训练

Result: DL算法使用原始信号达到85%准确率，传统ML和DL使用特征达到70-81%准确率，MVPA和LPA分类歧争更高

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在使用原始加速度信号时预测性能仅略好于使用手工特征的方法

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

Motivation: 反向传播算法存在生物学上不合理的反向锁定和全局误差传播等局限性，而Forward-Forward算法虽然更具生物学合理性，但在准确率上显著落后于反向传播，且推理效率低下。

Method: 将Forward-Forward算法与基于相似性的Tuplet损失函数框架相结合，提出FAUST算法，消除了推理时多次前向传播的需求。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FAUST显著提高了准确率。在CIFAR-10上使用简单多层感知机架构达到56.22%的准确率，接近反向传播的57.63%基准。

Conclusion: FAUST算法成功解决了Forward-Forward算法的准确率和效率问题，使其在保持生物学合理性的同时，性能接近传统的反向传播算法。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟具有连续性特征，连续状态极其相似，这一先验信息尚未被充分利用

Method: 将最先进的等变基础模型重构为深度平衡模型，重用先前时间步的中间神经网络特征

Result: 在MD17、MD22和OC20 200k数据集上，相比非DEQ基础模型，精度和速度均提升10-20%，训练内存效率更高，能够训练更大系统的更富表达力模型

Conclusion: 利用分子动力学模拟的连续性特征，通过深度平衡模型重用中间特征，是提升机器学习力场性能和效率的有效方法

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了针对轮廓系数的数据依赖上界，为聚类质量评估提供了更精确的基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准轮廓系数上限1通常无法达到，且数据集特定的最大轮廓宽度未知，需要更精确的上界来评估聚类质量

Method: 为每个数据点推导出轮廓宽度的尖锐上界，通过聚合这些个体界限得到ASW的规范数据依赖上界

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，界限被证明在许多情况下接近紧致，显著丰富了聚类质量评估

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示单个数据点是否能够被良好放置，支持基于轮廓的优化循环早期停止，并帮助评估聚类结果与最佳可能结果的接近程度

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度强化学习的AI决策支持系统，用于优化大规模伤亡事件中的患者转运分配决策，通过人机协作显著提升了决策质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件(MCI)会压垮医疗系统，需要在极端压力下做出快速准确的患者-医院分配决策，传统方法效率有限。

Method: 开发了基于深度强化学习的AI代理来优化患者转运决策，并构建了MasTER网络指挥仪表板。通过30名参与者(6名专家和24名非专家)的用户研究，在20人和60人MCI场景中评估了三种交互方式(纯人工、人机协作、纯AI)。

Result: AI参与度增加显著提高了决策质量和一致性。AI代理表现优于创伤外科医生(p < 0.001)，在AI辅助下非专家能达到专家水平，而未辅助时表现显著较差(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: AI驱动的决策支持系统有潜力提升MCI准备培训和实际应急响应管理能力。

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

*Jingya Cheng,Jiazi Tian,Federica Spoto,Alaleh Azhir,Daniel Mork,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种诊断信号保真指数(SFI)来量化电子健康记录中的诊断数据质量，并通过SFI意识的检验调整提高机器学习模型在不同健康系统间的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在不同健康系统间的性能退化是一个重要问题，其根源在于诊断信号衰减：不同机构在诊断质量和一致性上的差异影响了用于训练和预测的代码的可靠性。

Method: 研究构建了一个模拟框架生成2,500个合成数据集，每个包含1,000名患者的实际人口统计学特征、就诊情况和编码模式。SFI指数来自六个可解释的组成部分：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和趋势稳定性。采用乘性调整进行SFI意识的检验调整。

Result: 在最优参数(α=2.0)下，SFI意识的检验调整显著提高了所有指标(p<0.001)。收益范围从平衡准确率的10.3%到可回归率的32.5%，精确度(31.9%)和F1分数(26.1%)也有显著提高。性能接近参考标准，F1分数和可回归率在1%以内，平衡准确率和检测率分别提高了52.3%和41.1%。

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型普适化的可处理障碍。SFI意识的检验调整提供了一种实用的、无标签的策略，可在缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集中提高预测性能。

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Result: 实验结果显示，新协议在保持完美隐私的同时，性能与无安全聚合的模型相似，且在某些情况下在模型精度和余弦相似性方面显著超过有限域安全聚合方法。

Conclusion: 基于托默的安全聚合协议是更安全的选择，能够同时实现完美隐私和高精度模型训练。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Motivation: 电刺激映射(ESM)虽然是临床金标准，但有创且耗时，需要开发非侵入性替代方法用于脑部手术前的语言功能区定位。

Method: 分析16名参与者的颅内ECoG数据，整合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，使用RBF核SVM进行试验级预测，并通过MLP聚合电极级分类。

Conclusion: 结合空间和网络信息的非线性建模能显著改善术前功能定位，为无创语言功能区识别提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的服务器扩展方案，通过使用短暂性可信执行环境（TEE）模块来实现恶意安全的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法（DP-FTRL），解决了现有方案中服务器偏恶意假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DP-FTRL方法假设服务器是半恶意的，而且因为其状态性质，在客户端掉线或被突破的实际场景中存在安全风险。直接使用TEE可能导致分析攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 设计了一个作为可信计算基础（TCB）的服务器扩展，通过服务器端的短暂性TEE模块生成可验证的服务器操作证明。选中的客户端参与审计这些证明，仅需小量额外通信和计算开销。

Result: 该方案在保持系统可扩展性和活性的同时，减小了TCB的规模。通过交互式差分隐私进行了正式证明，在恶意环境中保证隐私性。实验结果显示，在多个实际场景下，该框架仅为客户端添加小量常数开销。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了在跨设备私有联邦学习中实现恶意安全DP-FTRL的挑战，通过使用短暂性TEE模块和客户端审计机制，在保持系统性能的同时提供了强大的安全保障。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Method: 受EfficientNet启发，提出了一种混合剪枝框架，同时进行通道剪枝和层剪枝，通过缩小网络规模来降低复杂度。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够显著降低模型的总体复杂度，而准确性与基准模型相比仅有最小程度的下降。在NVIDIA JETSON TX2嵌入式AI设备上部署时，这种复杂度降低转化为了更低的延迟。

Conclusion: 混合剪枝框架是一种有效的模型压缩方法，能够在保持高准确性的同时显著减少模型复杂度，从而提高在边缘设备上的部署效率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

Method: SAPO采用完全去中心化和异步的架构，在异构计算节点网络中运行，每个节点管理自己的策略模型并通过网络"共享"rollouts，无需假设延迟、模型同质性或硬件要求。

Result: 在控制实验中，SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益，并在数千个节点的网络测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SAPO成功解决了RL后训练的扩展瓶颈，为语言模型的强化学习训练提供了高效、低成本且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Conclusion: FLM是首个能够使用标准MLP架构表示多维完整可分离傅里叶基的神经网络模型，为科学计算问题提供了有效的谱基表示方法

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种基于学习的动态目标指向方法（强化学习和模仿学习），用于地球观测卫星的优化采样，与传统惯例方法相比科学信息收集量提高10-13.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集效率，采集最重要的科学信息。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预光仪器数据进行智能重新配置。

Method: 提出两种学习方法：1）强化学习方法 2）模仿学习方法。这些方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。

Result: 模仿学习方法比最佳惯例方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习方法平均提高13.7%。两种学习方法都可以使用较少的数据进行有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标指向应用中表现优异，能够显著提高地球观测卫星的科学信息收集效果，且训练效率高。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

TL;DR: EnvX是一个利用Agentic AI将GitHub仓库转化为智能代理的框架，通过自然语言交互和代理间协作实现软件组件的自动化重用，在GitTaskBench基准测试中表现优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件仓库数量庞大但利用率低，开发者需要手动查阅文档、理解API和编写集成代码，存在效率低下和错误率高的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) TODO引导的环境初始化；2) 人类对齐的代理自动化；3) 代理间(A2A)协作协议，结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试的18个跨领域仓库中，EnvX实现了74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架。

Conclusion: EnvX将仓库从被动代码资源转变为智能交互代理，提升了开源生态系统的可访问性和协作性。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中每个任务所有者独立评估所有协作设备的可信度会导致频繁数据交换、复杂推理和动态情境变化，造成显著开销和信任评估质量下降

Method: 基于大AI模型的师生代理架构，教师代理部署在服务器端负责多维信任数据收集、任务特定信任语义提取和任务-协作设备匹配分析，学生代理接收信任语义进行快速协作选择

Result: 实验结果表明2TSD模型能减少协作设备评估时间、降低设备资源消耗，并提高协作设备选择的准确性

Conclusion: 2TSD模型通过任务特定信任语义蒸馏有效解决了分布式信任评估中的开销和准确性问题，为复杂计算任务的协作设备选择提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Conclusion: ExRAP框架通过有效的环境探索和上下文记忆管理，显著提升了LLM在动态环境中的持续指令跟随性能，为解决非平稳环境中的具身任务规划问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Conclusion: 将基于偏好的学习技术与思维链过程结合，可有效提升视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力，TCPO方法为解决模型对齐问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

Motivation: 解决LLM作为评判者时的监督问题，避免无限循环监控，在缺乏真实标签时确保评估质量

Method: 利用不同LLM评判者之间的不一致性，通过线性规划模型计算评判能力，开发无知识告警系统

Result: 实现了无偏差告警，能够准确检测出至少一个评判者违反用户指定的评分能力要求

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性分析是有效监控LLM评判者的方法，无需真实标签即可发现错误评判，提供了可靠的评估质量保障

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为构建更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Motivation: 将AI系统的决策能力与故事推理能力结合起来，研究故事框架如何影响奖励基于学习

Method: 双系统架构：RL策略根据历史经验建议行动，语言模型通过不同故事框架处理建议指导决策，在可配置格子世界环境中实现

Result: 建立了一个模块化实验平台，能够控制测试环境复杂性、故事参数和RL与故事基于决策的交互作用

Conclusion: 该实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基于决策提供了基础，有助于探索优化基于学习与符号推理的潜在交互作用

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

Motivation: LLM服务在异构硬件环境中，现有并行化方法由于粗粒度和静态策略难以高效扩展，存在内存容量与计算能力不匹配、不同LLM模块性能差距导致的效率问题

Method: 采用细粒度动态并行设计：选择性并行化计算密集型操作降低延迟；以head粒度动态分配Attention计算到低端GPU；在线负载调度策略平衡网络延迟、计算负载和内存强度

Result: 评估结果显示，相比现有系统，Hetis可将服务吞吐量提升最多2.25倍，延迟降低1.49倍

Conclusion: Hetis通过针对异构环境的细粒度动态并行化方法，有效解决了LLM服务在混合GPU集群中的内存和计算效率问题，显著提升了服务性能

Abstract: The significant resource demands in LLM serving prompts production clusters
to fully utilize heterogeneous hardware by partitioning LLM models across a mix
of high-end and low-end GPUs. However, existing parallelization approaches
often struggle to scale efficiently in heterogeneous environments due to their
coarse-grained and static parallelization strategies.
  In this paper, we introduce Hetis, a new LLM system tailored for
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Hetis addresses two critical challenges: (1) memory
inefficiency caused by the mismatch between memory capacity and computational
power in heterogeneous devices, and (2) computational inefficiency arising from
performance gaps across different LLM modules. To tackle these issues, Hetis
employs a fine-grained and dynamic parallelism design. Specifically, it
selectively parallelizes compute-intensive operations to reduce latency and
dynamically distributes Attention computations to low-end GPUs at a head
granularity, leveraging the distinct characteristics of each module.
Additionally, Hetis features an online load dispatching policy that
continuously optimizes serving performance by carefully balancing network
latency, computational load, and memory intensity. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Hetis can improve serving throughput by up to $2.25\times$ and
reduce latency by $1.49\times$ compared to existing systems.

TL;DR: Duplex是一个统一的DFGL框架，通过联合优化网络拓扑和图形采样来显著降低通信成本并提高训练性能，在相同资源预算下准确率提升3.3%-7.9%，完成时间减少20.1%-48.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦图学习(DFGL)虽然通过P2P网络避免了参数服务器的瓶颈问题，但节点嵌入的大量跨工作节点通信带来了巨大的通信成本。现有方法单独使用稀疏网络拓扑或图邻居采样来缓解通信开销，但直接组合这些方法会导致训练性能显著下降。

Method: 提出Duplex统一框架，通过考虑网络拓扑和图采样的耦合关系进行联合优化。引入学习驱动算法自适应确定最优网络拓扑和图形采样比例，以应对统计异构性和动态网络环境等实际挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，Duplex在达到目标准确率时，完成时间减少20.1%-48.8%，通信成本降低16.7%-37.6%；在相同资源预算下，准确率提高3.3%-7.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex通过联合优化网络拓扑和图形采样，有效解决了DFGL中的通信效率问题，在降低通信成本的同时提升了训练性能，为实际DFGL应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (DFGL) overcomes potential bottlenecks
of the parameter server in FGL by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication network among workers. However, while extensive cross-worker
communication of graph node embeddings is crucial for DFGL training, it
introduces substantial communication costs. Most existing works typically
construct sparse network topologies or utilize graph neighbor sampling methods
to alleviate the communication overhead in DFGL. Intuitively, integrating these
methods may offer promise for doubly improving communication efficiency in
DFGL. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly combining
these methods leads to significant training performance degradation if they are
jointly optimized. To address this issue, we propose Duplex, a unified
framework that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling by
accounting for their coupled relationship, thereby significantly reducing
communication cost while enhancing training performance in DFGL. To overcome
practical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network
environments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively
determine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers.
Experimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by
20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target
accuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource
budgets compared to baselines.
