Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty\ninherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this\nuncertainty.

This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization\nof fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method\nis proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is\ncombined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was\napplied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for\nchoosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable\nsources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global\nclimate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period.

We apply this model to real data from a university HPC\ncluster and assess how different scenarios could affect the cost-effectiveness\nof this approach in the future."}

For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and\nsolutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear\noutput layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach\neffective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for\nsimultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a\nsignificant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic\ndifferentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and\nearly-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension\nto universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance\nacross constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per\nquery over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data."}

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)\nComparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to\nmodels based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison\nbetween (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks.

However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as\nContrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and\nresponse quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for\ndecoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a\nguard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially\nunsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe\noutputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;\nand (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model\ngenerates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates\nthese reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The\nframework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model\nfor precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and\nour novel introspection method for effective self-correction.

K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art\nscores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing\nstrongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a\nmore parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with\nstate-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that\nincludes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time\nenhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and\naffordable.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.

This leads to a challenging\ncold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test\nearly, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a\nstrategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical\ndrug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations\nand dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial\nexperiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional\ndiversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their\nhistorical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug\ncombination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial\nscreening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more\neffective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens."}

Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input\npairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring\ntokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by\nproposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured\nmatrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level\nLow Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional\ninputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any\nfixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality\npatterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws\ncompared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.\nAdditionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of\nefficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or\ndistance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings\nof standard attention.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language\nthrough pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of\nhuman language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which\nan LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed\nlanguage (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only\nTinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation\nwithin 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human\napproaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for\nevaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more\neffectively from interactive feedback."}

Efficient kernels are\ncrucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet\nattaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.\nCompiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial\nmanual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using\nLLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on\ntranslating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we\nintroduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel\noptimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA\nimplementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving\nLLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,\nspecialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,\nprofiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and\nhigh-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of\n1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study\nfurther demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,\noptimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast\nmath operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights\nmulti-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel\noptimization."}

Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut\nmicrobiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may\nserve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut\nmicrobiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single\nclassifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.\nTherefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods\ntailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine\nLearning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut\nMicrobiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39\nParkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially\nabundant taxa.

However, the translation by small open\nmodels remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by\nintroducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for\ndataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary\ntranslations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine\ntuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets\n(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the\nlargest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for\nrich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as\nRomanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references\nfrom the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine\ntuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to\ncapture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for\nefficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five\ndimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural\nadaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results\nshow that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with\ntop performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and\nsignificantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both\ndatasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus\nprovides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient\ntranslation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open\nmodels for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings."}
