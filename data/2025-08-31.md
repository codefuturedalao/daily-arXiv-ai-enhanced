TL;DR: SpeedMalloc使用轻量级支持核心处理多线程应用的内存分配任务，通过将分配器元数据隔离在专用核心缓存中，减少缓存冲突和跨核同步开销，相比现有软件和硬件分配器获得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存分配虽然只占代码的5%，但对程序性能有蝴蝶效应，可导致2.7倍的性能差异。现有加速器方案对多线程应用支持有限，跨核同步仍是主要挑战。

Method: 采用轻量级可编程支持核心处理内存分配任务，该核心具有高效的跨核数据同步能力，将所有分配器元数据存放在自身缓存中，避免与用户数据产生缓存冲突和跨核元数据同步。

Result: 在多线程工作负载上，SpeedMalloc相比Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento分别获得1.75倍、1.18倍、1.15倍、1.23倍和1.18倍的加速比。

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc通过专用支持核心的设计有效解决了多线程内存分配的缓存污染和同步开销问题，性能优于现有软件和硬件分配器方案。

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf利用LLMs实现硬件感知的GPU内核性能优化，自动生成空间优化模式，相比传统搜索方法效率大幅提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的LLM方法缺乏硬件感知能力，而人类性能工程师依赖硬件特性实现近最优性能。需要让LLMs具备硬件意识来进行软件级优化

Method: 通过提供工作负载的内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤的性能日志和历史性能反思，使LLMs具备硬件感知能力，自动为GPU内核生成空间优化模式

Result: 对于GEMM内核，SwizzlePerf在5分钟内生成专家需要2周找到的最优模式。在10个多样化内核中，9个实现最高2.06倍加速和70%的L2命中率提升

Conclusion: 这是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步，展示了硬件意识对自动性能优化的重要性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

### [3] [Predictable LLM Serving on GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20274)
*Erfan Darzi,Shreeanant Bharadwaj,Sree Bhargavi Balija*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一个主机级控制器，通过动态MIG重配置、PCIe感知放置和轻量级防护机制，有效减少共享A100集群中PCIe结构上的噪声邻居干扰，显著降低尾部延迟和SLO违规率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享A100集群中PCIe结构上的噪声邻居干扰会导致尾部延迟增加和SLO违规，影响延迟敏感型推理任务的性能。

Method: 结合动态多实例GPU（MIG）重配置、PCIe感知放置和轻量级防护机制（MPS配额、cgroup I/O），通过采样每个租户的尾部延迟和系统信号，利用拓扑提示避免PCIe热点，并通过驻留/冷却机制避免系统抖动。

Result: 在单主机和2节点（16-GPU）集群上，SLO违规率减少约32%（约1.5倍），p99延迟改善约15%，吞吐量成本≤5%；在LLM服务评估中，TTFT p99改善10-15%，成本≤5%。

Conclusion: 该控制器能有效缓解PCIe噪声干扰，显著提升延迟敏感型推理任务的性能，且无需修改控制器即可适用于LLM服务场景。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

### [4] [CoFormer: Collaborating with Heterogeneous Edge Devices for Scalable Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20375)
*Guanyu Xu,Zhiwei Hao,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Fuhui Sun,Xiaoyan Wang,Han Hu,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CoFormer是一个协作推理系统，通过将大型transformer模型分解为多个小模型在边缘设备上分布式推理，解决了计算资源受限的问题，实现了3.1倍加速和76.3%内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决transformer模型在资源受限边缘设备上部署的挑战，现有方法要么通信开销大，要么准确率与效率权衡不佳。

Method: 利用transformer的可分解性和可集成性，将大型模型分解为多个小模型进行分布式推理，使用DeBo算法优化分解策略并校准模型性能。

Result: 支持多种transformer模型在异构边缘设备上运行，实现3.1倍推理加速，内存需求减少76.3%，能耗降低约40%，同时保持满意的推理性能。

Conclusion: CoFormer为边缘设备上的大型transformer模型推理提供了有效的协作解决方案，在性能、效率和资源消耗方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

### [5] [pdGRASS: A Fast Parallel Density-Aware Algorithm for Graph Spectral Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20403)
*Tiancheng Zhao,Zekun Yin,Huihai An,Xiaoyu Yang,Zhou Jin,Jiasi Shen,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了pdGRASS并行算法，解决了现有feGRASS方法在并行化和偏斜输入上的问题，实现了3.9-8.8倍加速和更好的谱稀疏化质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feGRASS方法存在两个主要问题：1）由于严格的数据依赖难以并行化恢复步骤；2）在偏斜输入上性能下降，需要多次遍历才能恢复足够边

Method: 提出pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的互斥子任务，实现高效并行化和单次遍历的充分边恢复

Result: pdGRASS实现了平均3.9-8.8倍加速，稀疏化器质量在PCG迭代次数上表现更好（1.2倍高至1.8倍低），最坏情况下速度提升超过1000倍

Conclusion: pdGRASS在图谱稀疏化问题上显著提升了可扩展性和性能表现

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

*Yilin Li,Song Han,Sibo Wang,Ming Wang,Renzi Meng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出基于多智能体协同进化机制的智能服务优化方法，解决大规模微服务架构中的治理挑战，包括复杂服务依赖、动态拓扑结构和波动工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大规模微服务架构中的治理难题，包括复杂服务依赖关系、动态变化的拓扑结构以及波动的工作负载，这些因素使得传统治理方法难以有效应对。

Method: 将每个服务建模为智能体，引入图表示学习构建服务依赖图，使智能体能够感知系统结构变化。基于马尔可夫决策过程学习策略，采用集中训练分散执行框架，结合局部自主性和全局协调性。设计博弈驱动的策略优化机制，通过选择-变异过程动态调整智能体策略分布。

Result: 在代表性微服务仿真平台上进行实验，与多种先进方法进行对比分析。实验结果表明，该方法在多个关键指标上优于其他方法，显著提高了大规模微服务系统的治理效率和运行稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速响应突发工作负载激增、拓扑重构或资源冲突等场景，实现稳定的策略收敛，展现出强大的实用价值和工程可行性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL是一个基于大语言模型的少样本晶体生成模型，通过空间群晶体标记化方法和条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架，在四个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法利用少样本学习，而人类专家通常通过修改相关已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本ICL范式高度契合。

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；设计条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系。

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上均优于领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了LLM在材料科学中的应用性能。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

TL;DR: 通过在Transformer模型前端添加可学习频率筛波器，解决了Transformer在长时间序列预测中偏向低频的问题，在只增加约1000个参数的情况下实现了5-10%的性能提升，还能减小模型规模。


<details>

Motivation: Transformer模型在长时间序列预测中存在偏向低频数据的偏差，以及高计算和内存需求。虽然现有方法通过可学习频率筛波增强模型的谱利用能力，但仍未解决Transformer模型的问题。

Method: 在Transformer模型的前端添加可学习频率筛波器，这些筛波器只增加约1000个参数。通过这种方式增强模型对全谱段数据的利用能力。

Result: 在多个实例中观察到5-10%的相对预测性能提升。添加筛波器后，可以减小模型的嵌入维度，使得Transformer架构更小但效果更好。同时通过综合实验分析了筛波器如何帮助Transformer模型更好地利用全谱进行预测。

Conclusion: 在Transformer模型前端添加简单的可学习频率筛波器是一种高效的方法，能够显著提升长时间序列预测的性能，同时降低模型的计算复杂度和规模。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

*Heng-Sheng Chang,Prashant G. Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个概率模型，将transformer信号解释为条件度量的代理，并将层操作视为定点更新。对于隐马尔可夫模型这一特殊情况，给出了定点更新的显式形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 试图将经典的非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构联系起来，为transformer提供概率理论基础。

Method: 构建概率模型，将transformer的下一个token预测视为条件度量的非线性组合，层操作建模为定点更新过程。对于HMM特殊情况推导了显式更新公式。

Result: 成功建立了transformer与非线性滤波理论之间的联系，为HMM情况提供了具体的数学表达。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解transformer的运作机制提供了新的概率视角，有助于弥合经典控制理论与现代深度学习架构之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLM的对齐机制，在特定主题或查询上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查，而现有防御措施可能无法有效检测此类攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过精心设计的投毒数据，使模型在特定主题或查询上触发拒绝机制，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。攻击在联邦学习设置中实施，能逃避LLM状态取证和鲁棒聚合等防御技术。

Result: 实验显示，在仅1%数据投毒的情况下：ChatDoctor医疗应用对特定种族类别问题拒绝回答，导致高偏见(ΔDP 23%)；简历筛选管道对特定大学简历拒绝总结，导致选择偏见(ΔDP 27%)；其他9个聊天应用偏见更高(ΔDP ~38%)。

Conclusion: SAI攻击揭示了LLM对齐机制的安全漏洞，攻击者可以利用该机制植入偏见和审查，且能逃避现有防御。这突显了需要开发新的防御机制来检测和缓解此类针对性投毒攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TV-HSGT算法，一种基于混合随机梯度追踪和方差缩减机制的时间变化混合随机梯度追踪算法，用于时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化，无需梯度有界假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式在线优化算法通常依赖梯度有界假设，且忽视了随机梯度的影响，特别是在时变有向网络中。需要开发更有效的算法来处理动态数据和资源受限环境。

Method: TV-HSGT结合行随机和列随机通信方案，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息。通过组合当前和递归随机梯度来减少梯度方差并准确追踪全局下降方向。

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在不假设梯度有界的情况下实现改进的动态遗憾边界。逻辑回归任务的实验结果证实了算法在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了一种有效的解决方案，消除了对梯度有界假设的依赖，并在动态环境中表现出色。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CLD（损失差异相关性）核心集选择方法，通过测量训练样本与验证集损失轨迹的对齐程度来识别最具影响力的样本，无需昂贵梯度计算，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，需要高效的核心集选择方法来减少训练数据量同时保持性能。

Method: 使用CLD指标，仅需训练检查点的每样本损失值，测量训练样本与验证集损失轨迹的相关性，避免梯度计算。建立了理论框架证明收敛性保证。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD核心集通常优于或接近最先进方法，与计算昂贵基线相差不到1%。跨架构迁移有效，早期检查点稳定，具有固有偏差减少特性。

Conclusion: CLD是一种原理清晰、高效、稳定且可迁移的工具，适用于可扩展数据集优化。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的优化问题，将节点特定信息（标签和特征）整合到谱图聚类框架中，并开发了相应的算法解决方案。

Result: 理论分析表明合适的节点特定信息能够保证优化问题的解完美恢复社区结构，数值实验证实了图结构与节点特定信息之间的协同效应。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Motivation: 比较不同符号回归方法在从动态系统中发现方程的能力，特别是在复杂现象建模方面，为物理、生态学和流行病学等领域提供自动化方程发现的工具

Method: 使用五种符号回归方法对九个动态过程进行方程恢复测试，包括混沌动力学和流行病模型，重点关注PySR方法的表现

Result: PySR方法表现出最高的预测能力和准确性，某些估计结果与原始解析形式难以区分，证明其在推断方程方面的优越性

Conclusion: 符号回归是一个强大的工具，能够有效推断和建模现实世界现象，PySR方法特别适合用于动态系统的方程发现

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Motivation: 潜变量模型能够处理观测数据中的未观测因素，在因果推断中可以帮助解决由于缺失或未测量的协变量带来的挑战，特别是处理隐藏因素对处理或结果的影响

Method: 将潜变量建模整合到双机器学习范式中，考虑两种场景：潜变量仅影响结果，以及潜变量可能同时影响处理和结果。为了确保可处理性，仅在DML的第二阶段引入潜变量，将表示学习与潜变量推断分离

Result: 通过在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验，证明了该方法的稳健性和有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为存在隐藏因素时的因果效应估计提供了一个有效的框架，通过潜变量建模与双机器学习的结合提升了因果推断的稳健性

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Motivation: 传统统计和机器学习方法在处理复杂高维遗传数据时存在局限，需要评估大语言模型在遗传疾病诊断和研究中的潜力和挑战。

Method: 通过PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv的自动化关键词搜索，筛选并分析了172项关于LLM在遗传学诊断和教育应用的研究。

Conclusion: 该综述全面评估了LLM在遗传疾病诊断中的当前能力和局限性，为这一快速发展领域提供了导航指南，强调了临床转化和通用性的挑战。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Result: 数值实验结果包括真实世界实验和PDE相关科学问题，支持了VC的发现和预处理加速方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VC指标能够有效表征神经网络逼近的局部性能和行为，提出的预处理框架能够显著加速神经网络逼近过程，为解决神经网络不可预测的局部性能问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon是一种无需手动调优的逐通道后训练量化算法，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，在保持简单性的同时达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这种方法需要手动调优且效率低下。

Method: Beacon算法直接使用固定的非缩放字母表进行逐通道量化，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，不依赖反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的量化方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Beacon为高效模型部署提供了一个实用的解决方案，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了优异的量化性能。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界强化学习需要适应未见环境条件而不需要昂贵重新训练。现有cMDP方法通常需要显式上下文变量，这在上下文潜在或难以测量时限制了应用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动态，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 理论证明编码器对高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要。DALI在挑战性cMDP基准测试中显著优于上下文无关基线，在推断任务中常超越上下文感知基线。

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性，能够零样本泛化到未见过的上下文变化，为现实世界强化学习提供了有效的适应性解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异质性挑战，需要更轻量且语义丰富的微调方案。

Method: FedReFT应用稀疏干预层直接引导隐藏表示，并采用All-But-Me聚合策略来缓解表示级更新的聚合不匹配问题，实现个性化学习。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调优和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT持续优于最先进的PEFT方法，参数效率比基于LoRA的方法高7-15倍。

Conclusion: FedReFT为联邦学习提供了一种高效、轻量且语义丰富的微调范式，通过表示级操作和创新的聚合策略有效解决了异质性挑战。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够经验性地确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，具有重要实践意义

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Motivation: 现有方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种更高效、通用的优化问题表示方法。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模混合整数规划实例集合上进行无监督预训练，创建离散代码词汇表来表示优化实例。

Result: 在无监督设置下，Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例；在有监督设置下，单个模型可预测变量预热和割生成的完整性间隙，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，具有很好的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为优化问题的学习加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

TL;DR: 该研究建立了一个开放模拟器，比较了综合控制法（SCM）咄面板双机器学习方法（DML）在地理层面广告效果评估中的性能。结果显示面板DML方法在复杂场景下更加稳健，建议采用"先诊断后选择"的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化两边市场中地理层面的营销效果面临挑战：SCM方法强劲但系统性低估效果规模，而面板DML方法缺乏与SCM的直接比较。需要一个系统性的比较框架来评估这两类方法的性能。

Method: 建立了一个开放、全面文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理洗牌布局。设计五个精简测试场景：曲线基准趋势、异质响应滞后、处理偏罪冲击、非线性结果关联、控制组趋势漏洒。在每个场景下运行100次重复模拟，评估7种估计器（3种ASC变体咄4种面板DML方法）。

Result: 在涉及非线性或外部冲击的具有挑战性的场景中，ASC模型一质地显示出严重偏差和近于零的覆盖率。相比之下，面板DML变体显著减少了这种偏差，恢复了名义95%置信区间的覆盖率，证明其更加稳健。

Conclusion: 虽然ASC提供了简单的基准方法，但在常见的复杂情况下并不可靠。研究建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架：实践者首先识别主要的业务挑战（如非线性趋势、响应滞后），然后选择最适合该场景的具体DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更加稳健咄可靠的蓝图。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分段方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长分段，并提出与现代机器学习方法（通常需要固定长度输入）兼容的使用方式。使用新型信号生成器CTXGEN生成可控合成数据进行评估，并在真实EEG癫痫检测用例中验证。

Result: 使用CTXSEG预处理EEG数据在标准化框架下评估时，相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，且不需要修改机器学习方法，同时需要更少的分段数量。

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分段可以轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力提高性能，是信号预处理中有前景的固定长度分段替代方案，应该作为EEG机器学习应用标准预处理工具的一部分。

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过求解Riccati型矩阵微分方程，定量分析了梯度流在对称矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为，揭示了不同目标矩阵分量学习动态的时间尺度分离现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多理论研究将神经网络的优秀经验性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下的隐式偏置或正则化。本文旨在定量理解梯度流在过参数化矩阵分解问题中从小初始化开始的增量学习现象。

Method: 使用对称矩阵分解问题的闭式解（通过求解Riccati型矩阵微分方程获得），分析梯度流的学习动态，研究不同初始化尺度下时间尺度分离的特性。

Result: 研究发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量动态之间的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这些时间尺度分离更加明显，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解中的增量学习提供了定量框架，并讨论了将此类分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

TL;DR: DFAMS是一个基于动态信息流的新型联邦检索框架，通过识别潜在查询意图和构建语义对齐的知识分区，显著提升了跨域模糊查询的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以获取高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景下，限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用梯度信号和Shapley值归因探测LLMs中的动态信息流，识别查询意图和子域边界；通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度知识库内建模和跨知识库语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流技术有效解决了复杂联邦检索场景中的查询意图识别和跨域语义对齐问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Method: 提出多模态机器学习（MMML）架构，从同一数据的不同模态中学习来预测性能指标，使用训练好的模型对未见过的框架几何进行预测验证泛化能力。

Result: MMML方法在性能预测上优于传统单模态方法，能够成功泛化到训练数据集中未包含的新框架几何，展示了在实际工程应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态机器学习有潜力补充传统的基于模拟的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段，为机器学习在工程设计中的更广泛应用铺平道路，可优化结构开发和加速设计周期。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Motivation: ECG信号作为心脏数字孪生的基础数据源，经常受到噪声和伪影的影响，降低了其诊断价值，需要开发有效的去噪方法来保持信号的诊断完整性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功实现了线性复杂度的高效注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著提升了长序列处理的效率，为Transformer架构的长序列应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动或稀疏领域(如电力、汽车零部件)表现优于基础模型，且提供更可解释的结果；基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动场景(如金融)表现优异。

Conclusion: 模型选择应考虑领域特性，波动性强的领域更适合特征工程模型，而基础模型更适合稳定趋势场景，可解释性方法有助于评估模型可靠性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Motivation: 当前状态空间模型参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但对角化变体在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。然而HiPPO框架并未明确研究对角变体的作用，需要从频域角度系统理解对角SSM的参数化和学习偏差

Method: 从频域视角研究对角SSM初始化方案，分析极点放置的作用，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到最先进结果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头开始训练

Conclusion: 通过对角SSM初始化方案的频域分析，提出的S4D-DFouT方法不仅提升了模型效率，还在大规模长序列任务中实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一种新颖的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性度量来指导样本遗忘力度，并利用ICL生成的代理约束来防止过度遗忘，在保持模型效用的同时有效移除特定数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含私有或版权内容，现有遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）纠缠感知的损失重加权，通过嵌入空间相似性度量确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）代理约束，利用ICL生成的测试数据软正则化遗忘过程，防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上均显示出遗忘-效用权衡的持续改进，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as

unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text

benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the

Result: 在真实EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图和Transformer的结合，有效解决了EHR中高阶依赖关系建模的问题，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

attracted academic interest with more than 20 publications on topics such as
variable selection, classification, decision trees and co-clustering. It
provides a predictive measure of variable importance using discretisation
models for numerical data and value clustering for categorical data. The
proposed classification/regression model is a naive Bayesian classifier
incorporating variable selection and weight learning. In the case of
multi-table databases, it provides propositionalisation by automatically
constructing aggregates. Khiops is adapted to the analysis of large databases
with millions of individuals, tens of thousands of variables and hundreds of
millions of records in secondary tables. It is available on many environments,
both from a Python library and via a user interface.

### [42] [MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549)
*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗视觉语言模型框架，通过生成式奖励学习创建自我改进的良性循环，自动生成高质量多模态医疗数据，解决了医疗领域数据稀缺问题，显著提升了跨模态和跨任务的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型面临高质量专家标注数据稀缺的问题，传统监督微调在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。需要突破数据稀缺的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据。使用这些数据进行监督微调，并通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习。

Result: MedGR²生成的数据进行监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法。通过GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化方面达到最先进水平，性能优于专门的基于RL的方法。紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于综合评估的超参数优化方法，将多个性能指标整合为单一标准，用于推荐算法的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐算法优化通常只关注单一指标，无法平衡准确性、排序质量、多样性和资源消耗等多方面需求。

Method: 开发了一个通用的多标准优化工具，通过综合评估方法将多个性能指标整合为统一的优化标准。

Result: 该方法能够在推荐系统中实现多个性能维度之间的平衡优化。

Abstract: The article discusses the concept of hyperparametric optimization of
recommendation algorithms using an integral assessment that combines various
performance indicators into a single consolidated criterion. This approach is
opposed to traditional methods of setting up a single metric and allows you to
achieve a balance between accuracy, ranking quality, variety of output and the
resource intensity of algorithms. The theoretical significance of the research
lies in the development of a universal multi-criteria optimization tool that is
applicable not only in recommendation systems, but also in a wide range of
machine learning and data analysis tasks.

### [44] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过最大范数和元素级信任比解决大批次训练中的注意力层信息瓶颈问题，在GPT-2模型上实现了6k批次大小无性能下降的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器（如AdamW和LAMB）在大批次语言模型训练中存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力logit急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束最大值且忽略了权重内部关系。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1）使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力logit；2）构建元素级信任比，通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行大量实验，MERIT表现出优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）且48B训练token下无任何性能下降。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了大批次训练中考虑最大注意力logit和细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平了道路，能够加速大型语言模型的开发和迭代。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机超参数学习方法依赖近似计算，无法保证收敛到真实边际似然的稳定点，需要更精确的推理方法

Method: 针对有限维RKHS核函数设计精确随机推理算法，可扩展到无限维RKHS但需要牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，该方法在有限维和无限维RKHS中都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 提出的精确随机推理算法为高斯过程超参数学习提供了更可靠的解决方案，特别是在计算资源受限的场景下表现优异

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种称为局部虚拟节点(LVN)的方法，通过在强中心性节点附近添加可训练嵌入的虚拟节点，来缓解图神经网络训练中的过压问题，同时保持原始图的全局结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在长距离依赖任务中遇到的过压问题，传统的图重新连线和添加虚拟节点方法会改变图的全局拓扑结构，破坏原始图结构中编码的领域知识。

Method: 提出使用局部虚拟节点(LVN)，通过节点中心性指标确定潜在瓶颈区域，在这些区域添加可训练嵌入的虚拟节点。LVN在选定的中央区域之间共享，为远程节点提供通信途径，无需增加更多的网络层。

Result: 在标准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果显示LVN能够增强结构连通性，并在图分类和节点分类任务上显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: LVN方法能够有效缓解图神经网络中的过压问题，同时最小程度地影响原始图的全局结构，为长距离依赖任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务的调查数据可信度评估方法，通过模型特定的距离度量来验证样本调查是否可信代表总体，算法样本复杂度与数据维度无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高维分布距离估计需要样本量随维度指数增长，但实际数据分析中结论可能在不同分布下保持一致，需要更高效的验证方法。

Method: 设计了模型特定的距离度量来量化调查可信度，开发了回归模型背景下验证调查数据可信度的算法，避免重建回归模型。

Result: 算法样本复杂度与数据维度无关，相比重建回归模型的方法（样本复杂度随维度线性增长）更高效，理论正确性得到证明。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的可信度评估方法能够高效验证调查数据质量，为下游研究提供可靠的统计推断基础。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测和结构健康监测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在计算机视觉等领域已证明有效，但在1D超声信号分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用MAE框架在无标签合成超声信号上进行自监督预训练，系统研究了模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游任务准确性的影响。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头训练的模型和针对下游任务优化的CNN基线，且在合成数据上预训练展现出比仅在有限真实数据上训练更好的向真实测量信号的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习推动超声信号分析的潜力，为处理标注数据稀缺的工业应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Method: 开发GDS代理，提供全面的图算法工具集，包括预处理（检索）和算法结果后处理，通过MCP服务器与任何现代LLM集成

Result: GDS代理能够解决广泛的图任务，新基准测试显示其在中间工具调用和最终响应方面表现良好

Conclusion: GDS代理有效增强了LLM的图算法推理能力，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步发展和完善

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Conclusion: 组合性方法能够有效生成高质量的合成临床时间序列数据，为解决临床数据稀缩问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明工具增强语言模型通过外部检索（工具学习）比权重记忆（权重学习）在事实回忆方面具有根本优势，工具使用可实现无限制的事实回忆，而纯记忆受参数数量限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强语言模型（配备检索、记忆或外部API）正在重塑AI，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要研究工具使用相对于纯记忆的理论优势。

Method: 通过理论证明和受控实验验证：1）证明纯权重记忆的事实数量受参数数量限制；2）构建简单高效电路证明工具使用可实现无限制事实回忆；3）在预训练大语言模型中比较工具使用教学与事实微调的效果。

Result: 工具使用模型在受控实验中始终优于纯记忆模型；教授工具使用和通用规则比将事实微调到内存中更有效；提供了理论和实证基础证明工具增强工作流程的可扩展性优势。

Conclusion: 工具增强工作流程不仅实用，而且被证明更具可扩展性，工具使用使语言模型能够突破参数限制实现无限制的事实回忆能力。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Conclusion: SAFEMax为扩散模型中的机器遗忘提供了一种有效且高效的解决方案，通过信息论方法实现了对特定类别内容的精确遗忘。

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LLM指导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合机制为多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的部署提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基于Transformer架构的方法在可扩展、高性能自动特征变换方面的潜力，为特征工程领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间模体和自适应时间窗口，显著提升了金融欺诈检测的性能，能够捕捉传统方法忽略的多步骤欺诈方案。

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Method: 从Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库中聚合数据，标准化数据表示，统一结果并过滤高质量构型，涵盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等常用DFT泛函。

Result: 通过在高力数据预训练模型上使用LeMat-Traj进行微调，在弛豫任务中显著降低了力预测误差。数据集包含低能态和高能高力结构，补充了分子动力学和主动学习数据集。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj显著降低了训练可迁移和准确MLIPs的门槛，同时提供了LeMaterial-Fetcher开源库作为可复现框架，支持社区持续扩展新材料数据集。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了学习型方法的高效性和采样规划器的安全性保证，为复杂动力学系统提供了既快速又安全的运动规划解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: 随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD和SPRING的理论理解提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.
