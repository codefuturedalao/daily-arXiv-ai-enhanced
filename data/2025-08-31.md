### [1] [CrystalICL: Enabling In-Context Learning for Crystal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20143)
*Ruobing Wang,Qiaoyu Tan,Yili Wang,Ying Wang,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CrystalICL模型，用于few-shot晶体材料生成，通过空间群token化方法和混合指令调优框架，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，而人类专家通常通过修改已知结构来设计新材料，这与few-shot ICL范式更契合

Method: 引入基于空间群的晶体token化方法降低对称性建模复杂度；提出条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上均优于领先的基线方法

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了few-shot晶体生成，通过有效的token化和指令调优策略，能够从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

### [2] [Filter then Attend: Improving attention-based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20206)
*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在Transformer模型中添加可学习频率滤波器，仅增加约1000个参数量，就能在长时序预测任务中实现5-10%的相对性能提升，同时还能减小模型尺寸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在长时序预测中存在对低频数据的偏好问题，以及高计算和内存需求。虽然可学习频率滤波器被证明可以提升模型的频谱利用率，但之前的工作使用MLP处理滤波信号，未能解决Transformer模型的问题。

Method: 在Transformer模型的开端添加可学习频率滤波器，滤波器仅增加约1000个参数。通过合成实验分析滤波器如何帮助Transformer模型更好地利用全频谱进行预测。

Result: 在多个实例中观察到5-10%的相对预测性能提升。添加滤波器后能够减小模型的嵌入维度，使得基于Transformer的架构既更小又比无滤波器的基础模型更有效。

Conclusion: 在Transformer模型前端添加轻量级可学习滤波器是提升长时序预测性能的有效方法，既能改善频谱利用率，又能减小模型规模。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

### [3] [What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20211)
*Heng-Sheng Chang,Prashant G. Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过概率模型将transformer解释为条件度量的代理，将层操作视为定点更新，并针对隐马尔可夫模型给出了定点更新的显式形式，旨在连接经典非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Wiener线性预测器扩展到非线性预测器，用概率模型解释transformer信号作为条件度量的代理，试图弥合经典非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构之间的差距。

Method: 提出概率模型将transformer解释为条件度量的代理，层操作为定点更新，针对隐马尔可夫模型给出了定点更新的显式形式。

Result: 建立了transformer与条件度量代理之间的理论联系，为隐马尔可夫模型提供了具体的定点更新公式。

Conclusion: 该工作成功地将transformer架构与经典非线性滤波理论联系起来，为理解现代推理架构提供了新的概率视角和理论基础。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

### [4] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLM的对齐机制，在特定主题或查询上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)通过对齐训练来拒绝回答有害或不安全的提示，但攻击者可以利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施针对性审查，而现有防御措施无法有效检测这种攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定模式的拒绝响应，使模型在预定义的主题或查询上触发拒绝回答，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒就能在ChatDoctor等应用中导致对特定种族医疗问题的高偏见(ΔDP 23%)，在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见，在其他9个聊天应用中偏见高达38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效规避现有最先进的投毒防御机制，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术，揭示了LLM对齐机制可能被滥用于植入偏见的安全风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

### [5] [The Role of Teacher Calibration in Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20224)
*Suyoung Kim,Seonguk Park,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现教师模型的校准误差与学生模型精度强相关，提出通过降低教师模型校准误差来提升知识蒸馏效果，该方法具有通用性且易于集成到现有方法中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然知识蒸馏在深度学习模型压缩中表现出色，但尚不清楚哪些因素真正影响学生模型性能提升。本文旨在探索教师模型校准对学生性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析教师模型校准误差与学生精度的相关性，提出使用校准方法来降低教师模型的校准误差，从而改善知识蒸馏效果。

Result: 实验表明该方法在分类、检测等多种任务中都有效，且能轻松与现有先进方法集成， consistently 获得 superior 性能。

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是知识蒸馏中的重要因素，通过简单的校准方法就能显著提升蒸馏效果，该方法具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking Method for Distributed Online Optimization Over Time-Varying Directed Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20645)
*Xinli Shi,Xingxing Yuan,Longkang Zhu,Guanghui Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TV-HSGT算法，在时变有向网络中结合行随机和列随机通信方案，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息，通过混合随机梯度跟踪和方差缩减机制，在无梯度有界假设下实现更好的动态遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式在线优化在实时决策中日益重要，但现有算法依赖梯度有界假设且忽略随机梯度影响，特别是在时变有向网络中的性能问题。

Method: 基于混合随机梯度跟踪和方差缩减机制，集成行随机和列随机通信方案，结合当前和递归随机梯度来减少梯度方差并准确跟踪全局下降方向。

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在无梯度有界假设下获得改进的动态遗憾界，逻辑回归任务的实验结果验证了其在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法通过创新的通信方案和梯度处理机制，有效解决了时变有向网络中分布式在线优化的挑战，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

### [7] [Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230)
*Manish Nagaraj,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CLD（损失差异相关性）核心集选择方法，通过验证集损失轨迹对齐来识别关键训练样本，无需昂贵梯度计算，在多个数据集和架构上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，需要高效的核心集选择方法来减少训练数据量同时保持性能。

Method: CLD方法通过计算训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的相关性来选择最具影响力的样本，仅需每个样本的损失值，避免了梯度计算等昂贵操作。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD通常优于或接近最先进方法，即使在不领先时也保持在计算昂贵基线1%以内，跨架构迁移性能损失小于1%。

Conclusion: CLD是一种原则性、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，具有内在偏差减少特性，适用于可扩展的深度学习训练。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

TL;DR: 提出了INS2ANE框架，通过新颖性评分和战略采样机制增强自主实验中的新现象发现能力，相比传统优化方法显著提高了探索多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验主要关注预定义目标的优化，限制了意外或未知物理现象的发现，需要一种能够增强新现象发现能力的新方法

Method: 集成两个关键组件：1)评估实验结果独特性的新颖性评分系统；2)促进探索欠采样区域的战略采样机制，即使这些区域按传统标准看起来不太有前景

Result: 在已知真实数据的预采集数据集上验证有效，并在自主扫描探针显微镜实验中实施，显著增加了探索现象的多样性，提高了发现未观察现象的可能性

Conclusion: INS2ANE框架展示了自主实验在增强科学发现深度方面的潜力，结合自主实验的效率，有望通过同时探索复杂实验空间来加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

*Beatriz R. Brum,Luiza Lober,Isolde Previdelli,Francisco A. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了五种符号回归方法在恢复九个动态过程方程方面的表现，发现PySR方法在推断方程方面最为合适，具有高预测能力和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从数据中发现方程是物理学和其他研究领域的核心过程。随着多种符号回归方法的出现，需要比较它们在复杂动态系统中的表现，特别是对于描述混沌动力学和流行病学模型等复杂现象的系统。

Method: 使用五种符号回归方法对九个动态过程进行方程恢复，包括混沌动力学和流行病模型，并比较它们的性能表现。

Result: PySR方法被证明是最适合推断方程的方法，基准测试结果显示其具有高预测能力和准确性，某些估计结果与原始解析形式无法区分。

Conclusion: 符号回归具有作为推断和建模现实世界现象的稳健工具的潜力，PySR方法在此类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个将潜在变量建模整合到双机器学习框架中的新方法，用于在存在隐藏因素的情况下进行稳健的因果效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在变量模型能够处理观测数据中未观测到的因素，在因果推断中帮助解决由缺失或未测量协变量带来的挑战。

Method: 将潜在变量建模整合到双机器学习范式，考虑两种场景：潜在变量仅影响结果，或同时影响处理和结果。为了确保可处理性，仅在DML的第二阶段引入潜在变量，将表示学习与潜在推断分离。

Result: 通过在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验，证明了该方法的稳健性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为存在隐藏因素的因果推断问题提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过潜在变量建模增强了双机器学习框架的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: 本综述全面分类和评估了LLMs在遗传疾病诊断和遗传教育中的当前能力和限制，为该快速发展的领域提供了导航指南，指出了多模态数据整合和临床实施方面的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VC（值变化）的新度量指标，用于衡量神经网络逼近任务的难度和近似效果，并通过数值实验支持其对神经网络逼近局部性能和行为的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在关键应用中经常遭受不可预测的局部性能问题，这阻碍了其可靠性。VC通过提供网络行为局部值变化的可量化度量来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出VC度量指标来测量函数局部值变化，研究其理论性质，发现VC趋势和少数趋势现象，并基于VC提出新的距离度量和预处理框架。

Conclusion: VC为神经网络逼近提供了有价值的局部性能分析工具，新的预处理框架能够加速逼近过程，提高神经网络的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

### [15] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon是一种无需手动调优的逐通道后训练量化算法，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，在保持简单性的同时达到与最先进方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这个过程需要手动操作且效率低下。

Method: Beacon算法直接使用固定的非缩放字母表进行逐通道PTQ，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，且不依赖反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相当，为高效模型部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种简单有效的量化方法，消除了手动调优的需求，在保持竞争力的同时简化了模型压缩过程。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

TL;DR: DALI是一个在Dreamer架构中集成的新框架，通过自监督编码器从智能体-环境交互中推断潜在上下文表示，实现零样本泛化到未见过的环境变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习需要适应未见环境条件而不需要昂贵重新训练的问题，现有方法需要显式上下文变量，限制了在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动态，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的cMDP基准测试中，DALI相比无上下文感知基线取得显著提升，在推断任务中经常超越上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化到未见过的上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过推断潜在上下文表示，有效解决了cMDP中上下文变量难以测量的问题，理论证明了编码器对高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化的必要性，潜在空间支持反事实一致性。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedReFT是一种联邦学习中的参数高效微调方法，通过直接操作隐藏表示而非更新模型权重，在保持高参数效率的同时解决了表示级更新的聚合不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的参数高效微调方法在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源的异质性挑战，特别是表示级微调在聚合时容易出现语义对齐问题。

Method: 提出FedReFT方法，在客户端应用稀疏干预层直接引导隐藏表示，并设计All-But-Me聚合策略，让每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并进行部分整合。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令微调和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT consistently优于最先进的PEFT方法，参数效率比基于LoRA的方法高7-15倍。

Conclusion: FedReFT为边缘设备提供了轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过平衡局部专注和全局知识实现了稳定和个性化的联邦学习。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性局限，依赖少数管理者的狭隘视角，容易忽视合格候选人

Method: 使用双图卷积网络（GCN）和门控机制，分别建模员工的任务语义相似度图和协作结构图，并自适应融合这两个维度

Result: 在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的顶级性能，显著优于其他融合策略和启发式基线，对不同职位家族学习到不同的融合策略

Conclusion: 该研究提供了量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够经验性地确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，具有重要实践意义

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种能够跨问题类型通用的预训练方法。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模多样化MIP实例集上进行无监督预训练，通过离散代码分配创建表示优化实例的词汇表。

Result: Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例，单个模型可预测预热变量和整数间隙，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种通用的MIP实例级嵌入方法，显著提高了优化求解的效率和泛化能力，为后续研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过模拟器测试了两种地理市场营销效果量化方法的表现，发现面板双重机器学习方法比综合控制方法更加稳健和准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在两边市场中准确量化地理层面的营销效果很困难，综合控制方法强力但系统性低估效果大小，而面板双重机器学习方法缺乏与综合控制方法的相应对比。

Method: 建立了一个开放、全面文档化的模拟器，模仿大规模地理滚动部署。在5种类型化压力测试中评估了7种估计器：3种增强型综合控制方法和4种面板双重机器学习方法。

Result: 增强型综合控制方法在复杂场景中显示出严重偏差和接近零的覆盖率，而面板双重机器学习方法显著减少了偏差并恢复了名义95%置信区间的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 增强型综合控制方法虽然简单，但在常见复杂情况下不可靠。建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架，根据具体业务挑战选择最适合的双重机器学习模型。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分割方法，用于EEG信号处理，相比固定长度分割能提高癫痫检测性能并减少所需片段数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG机器学习使用固定时间片段分割，但大脑状态并不局限于固定间隔，需要更符合生物学相关性的自适应分割方法

Method: 开发CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长片段，并使用CTXGEN合成数据生成器进行评估验证

Result: CTXSEG在癫痫检测任务中相比固定长度分割方法性能更优，且需要更少的片段数量

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割方法可轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，是EEG机器学习应用中信号预处理的有前景替代方案

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 该论文通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，对对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的增量学习行为进行了定量分析，揭示了小初始化下按奇异值大小顺序学习的时间尺度分离机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究将神经网络的优异性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化条件下的隐式偏置或正则化效应，本文旨在定量理解对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的增量学习现象。

Method: 使用Riccati类矩阵微分方程的闭式解来分析对称矩阵分解问题中的梯度流行为，研究不同初始化尺度下时间尺度分离的机制。

Result: 发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这种时间尺度分离更加显著，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为提供了定量框架，并讨论了将分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以获取高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景下，这限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用梯度信号和Shapley值归因探测LLMs中的动态信息流，识别查询意图和子域边界；通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度知识库内建模和跨库语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%，显著优于先进联邦检索方法。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流有效解决了联邦检索中的模糊查询问题，在复杂跨域场景下表现出色，为LLMs的外部知识获取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Motivation: Airbnb传统依赖结构化数据来处理房源信息，但文本和图像等非结构化数据包含丰富信息。现有方法难以有效整合房源的多图像、多文本等多样化非结构化数据，需要一种能统一表示多模态信息的方法。

Method: 提出BiListing（双模态房源）方法，利用大语言模型和预训练的语言-图像模型，将房源的文本和照片数据进行对齐和融合，为每个房源生成单一的多模态嵌入向量表示。

Conclusion: BiListing方法有效解决了多模态数据融合的挑战，实现了零样本语义搜索、克服冷启动问题，并支持跨模态的房源搜索，为Airbnb的业务带来了显著价值。

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Motivation: ECG信号作为心脏数字孪生的基础数据源，经常受到噪声和伪影的影响，诊断效用受到限制，需要开发有效的去噪方法来保持信号的诊断完整性。

Method: 提出TF-TransUNet1D一维深度神经网络，整合U-Net编码器-解码器架构和Transformer编码器，采用双域损失函数同时优化时域波形重建和频域谱保真度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的几何正则化方法——非线性保角正则化，用于深度神经网络解码器映射，能够量化潜在空间到原始数据空间的局部变形程度，并计算学习流形的标量曲率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维的目标是发现解释数据的主要因素，自编码器是学习低维表示的有效方法。但传统方法缺乏对解码器映射几何特性的量化分析，需要新的正则化技术来理解潜在空间的局部变形特性。

Method: 引入非线性保角正则化技术，通过约束解码器映射的局部几何特性，生成一个称为保角因子的标量场，该因子量化了潜在空间映射到原始数据空间时的局部变形程度。

Result: 该方法能够有效计算学习流形的标量曲率，在Swiss roll和CelebA数据集上的实验验证了该架构能够获得这些几何量。

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了一种新的几何约束方法，不仅能够学习低维表示，还能量化分析潜在空间的几何变形特性，为理解学习流形的几何结构提供了新工具。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

TL;DR: 时间序列预测模型的解释性分析：结合XAI和RDE方法，评估四种模型在不同预测领域的性能和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中存在性能变化大、模型不透明等问题，需要提高用户对模型输出的理解和信任

Method: 结合传统的可解释性AI(XAI)方法和评分驱动解释(RDE)，评估ARIMA、Gradient Boosting、Chronos和Llama四种模型在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售领域的表现

Result: 特征工程模型(Gradient Boosting)在波动性高或数据稀疏领域(如能源、汽车零件)表现更好且更可解释，而基础模型(Chronos)仅在稳定或趋势驱动的场景(如金融)中表现优异

Conclusion: 不同模型在不同领域各有优势，特征工程模型在复杂场景下更具解释性优势，为实际应用中的模型选择提供了指导

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSM参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但对角变体的作用未被充分研究。对角SSM虽然效率更高，但其初始化机制和学习偏差缺乏系统理解。

Method: 从频率角度系统研究对角SSM初始化方案，分析参数化方法和学习偏差，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT。

Result: 提出的S4D-DFouT方法在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art结果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头训练。

Conclusion: 通过对角SSM初始化中极点放置作用的深入理解，成功扩展了模型规模并取得了优异性能，为大规模序列建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似度测量和ICL生成数据的软约束，解决了现有方法遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精确的数据移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架：1）基于嵌入空间相似度的纠缠感知损失重加权，确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束进行软正则化，防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上 consistently 改善了遗忘-效用的权衡，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Method: 提出Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer框架：1) 使用超图结构编码器捕捉医疗代码间的高阶交互；2) 集成Transformer架构对整个超图进行推理；3) 设计包含超图重建的定制损失函数以保持原始结构

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图结构和Transformer的有效结合，成功解决了EHR中高阶依赖关系建模的问题，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗AI框架，通过生成式奖励学习创建自我改进的数据生成和奖励模型循环，解决了医疗领域高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了跨模态和跨任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受限于高质量专家标注数据的稀缺性，传统监督微调方法在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习。

Result: 使用MedGR²生成数据进行监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法；结合GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化方面达到最先进水平，性能超越专门的RL方法；紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的高效学习提供了新范式，将数据稀缺问题转化为数据生成问题，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

TL;DR: MERIT是一种针对大批次训练优化的新型优化器，通过最大范数和逐元素信任比来有效约束注意力层的最大logit值，解决了AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大批次训练在加速深度神经网络训练中很重要，但现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在语言模型的大批次训练中存在性能下降问题，主要由于注意力层中最大注意力logit的急剧增加造成的信息瓶颈。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力logit，并构建逐元素信任比通过关注局部权重结构提供更鲁棒的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行的大批次训练实验显示MERIT具有优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小而没有任何性能下降，相比标准批次大小（480）和48B训练token。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力logit和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次的使用铺平了道路，使大型语言模型的开发和迭代更快。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Method: 针对产生中等有限维再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的核函数，提出精确随机推理算法，也可扩展到无限维RKHS但会牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，无论是有限维还是无限维RKHS，该方法都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了更可靠的解决方案，特别是在计算资源受限的场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长距离依赖任务时面临过压缩问题，现有方法如图重连和添加虚拟节点会改变图的全局拓扑结构，破坏原始图结构中的领域知识。

Method: 提出局部虚拟节点(LVN)方法，根据节点中心性确定LVN位置，在潜在瓶颈区域添加可训练的虚拟节点嵌入，共享于选定中心区域以促进远距离节点通信。

Conclusion: LVN方法有效缓解了过压缩问题，同时保持了输入图的全局结构完整性，为图神经网络的长距离依赖处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Conclusion: 任务导向的可信度验证方法比传统分布距离估计更高效，特别适用于高维数据分析场景，为调查数据质量评估提供了新思路

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Result: 构建了新的测试标准，结果显示GDS代理能够处理广泛的图结构任务，提供了详细案例研究和性能分析

Conclusion: GDS代理有效解决了LLM在图数据处理方面的限制，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Result: 与Diff-Instruct相比，VarDiU实现了更高的生成质量，并提供了更高效和稳定的训练过程

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的局限性，在一步扩散蒸馏中表现出优越的性能

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的增长，通过微调进行有害滥用的风险也在增加。现有研究主要关注SFT的滥用，但RL可能带来更大的系统性风险，需要专门的防御机制。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，通过熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制来抑制模型响应不确定性，防止RL利用不同的奖励信号驱动模型产生有害行为。

Result: 在多个模型和RL算法上的广泛实验表明，TokenBuncher能够稳健地减轻有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和可微调性。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT构成更大的系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了一种有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Conclusion: EEGDM展示了良好的泛化能力和实用价值，为EEG信号分析提供了有效的自监督表示学习框架

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Motivation: 工具增强语言模型（配备检索、记忆或外部API）正在重塑AI，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在通过比较工具学习（外部检索）和权重学习（记忆）在事实回忆方面的表现，填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析和受控实验验证：1）证明模型仅通过权重记忆事实的数量受参数数量限制；2）构建简单高效的电路证明工具使用可实现无限制事实回忆；3）在预训练大语言模型上比较工具使用教学与事实微调的效果。

Result: 理论分析表明工具使用可实现无限制事实回忆，而权重记忆存在根本性限制。实验验证显示工具使用模型在事实回忆方面始终优于纯记忆模型。对于预训练大语言模型，教授工具使用和通用规则比将事实微调到内存中更有效。

Conclusion: 研究为工具增强工作流程提供了理论和实证基础，证明其不仅实用，而且在可扩展性方面具有可证明的优势。工具使用能够突破模型参数数量的限制，实现无限制的事实回忆能力。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基于transformer架构在可扩展、高性能自动特征变换方面的潜力。

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用了时间motif和自适应时间窗口两个关键时间特征，显著提升了金融欺诈检测的性能

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Motivation: 解决社区健康干预、定向数字广告等场景中的序列资源分配问题，其中干预效果会随时间动态变化（习惯化或恢复效应），需要平衡个体异质性奖励和探索-利用权衡。

Method: 开发了首个在组合多臂老虎机文献中纳入非平稳奖励的框架，设计了具有动态遗憾理论保证的算法。

Conclusion: 该工作将自适应学习的理论进展与人口层面行为改变干预的实际挑战相结合，验证了框架在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统采样规划器动作采样效率低，以及学习式方法缺乏安全保证和泛化能力的问题

Method: 将扩散策略作为知情采样器来指导状态空间搜索，结合RRT规划器和在单一环境中训练的扩散策略动作采样器

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比其他方法高约30%

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了扩散策略的复杂分布建模能力和采样规划器的完备性，为复杂动力系统提供可证明安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Conclusion: RLG为扩散模型对齐提供了实用且理论可靠的解决方案，支持插值和外推，提供了前所未有的生成对齐控制灵活性。

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Motivation: 解决现有检索模型只关注查询相关性而忽视多样性的问题，多样性对上下文学习至关重要

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的上下文示例；2) 引入组合式训练范式，通过基于似然的损失函数学习SMI参数；3) 使用合成生成的释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在九个基准数据集上显示出显著改进，验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中表现出色，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白，为SNGD及其加速变体SPRING提供理论分析基础。

Method: 通过将SNGD和SPRING与正则化Kaczmarz方法建立等价关系，利用随机线性代数工具分析收敛性。在线性最小二乘问题中证明等价性，并扩展到一般强凸二次损失函数。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，并证明了SPRING能够加速SNGD。在更强条件下，将分析扩展到一般强凸二次损失函数。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD在最小二乘之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

TL;DR: SpeedMalloc使用轻量级支持核心处理多线程应用的内存分配任务，通过专用核心存储分配器元数据来减少缓存冲突和同步开销，相比现有软件和硬件分配器获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存分配虽然只占代码的5%，但对程序性能有蝴蝶效应影响，可达2.7倍性能差异。现有加速器方案对多线程支持有限，核心与加速器间同步仍是挑战

Method: 采用轻量级可编程支持核心处理内存分配任务，该核心具有高效跨核数据同步能力，将所有分配器元数据存储在自己的缓存中，避免与用户数据缓存冲突和跨核元数据同步

Result: 在多线程工作负载上，相比Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento分别获得1.75倍、1.18倍、1.15倍、1.23倍和1.18倍的加速

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc通过专用支持核心的设计有效解决了多线程内存分配的缓存污染和同步开销问题，相比现有最佳方案都有显著性能提升，且通用核心设计便于采用新的分配器设计

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

Conclusion: 这是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步，展示了LLM在硬件特定优化方面的巨大潜力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Motivation: 现有feGRASS方法存在两个主要问题：1) 恢复步骤难以并行化（严格的数据依赖性） 2) 在偏斜输入上性能下降，需要多次遍历才能恢复足够边

Method: 提出pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的独立子任务，实现高效并行化和单次遍历的充分边恢复

Conclusion: pdGRASS在图谱稀疏化问题上显著提升了可扩展性和性能

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.
